<p><b>Show Notes</b><br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/-inside-apples-internal-training-program-.html">The New York Times</a> spoke with three Apple employees about a training program known as Apple University. Steve Jobs started the program in 2008 and hired the dean of Yale’s School of Management to head it. Classes are described using things like Picasso’s “The Bull” to illustrate simplification. The classes are taught year-round tailored to particular positions within the company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/intel-takes-wraps-off-core-m-processor-that-can-enable-pcs-without-fans/">CNET reports</a> Intel’s long-delayed 14 nm Broadwell chips are finally in significant production. Intel said the first systems using Core M, the lowest power Broadwell variant, will hit store shelves during the holiday season. Most Broadwell powered devices will come in 2015. The Core M &#8220;enables less than 9 millimeter fanless two-in-ones for the first time from Intel. Core M is 50% smaller, 30% thinner and has a 60% lower power idle than Haswell.	</p>
<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/08/11/google-backing-new-300-million-high-speed-internet-trans-pacific-cable-system-us-japan/">The Next Web reports</a> Google has joined an effort to create a Trans-Pacific cable system called Faster by Q2 2016. Google joins China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit, KDDI, and SingTel, with NEC as the system supplier of the $300 million project. FASTER will feature 6-fiber-pair cable and optical transmission with expected capacity of 60Tb/s  connecting the West coast of the US with Chikura and Shima Japan.	</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20140809000040&#038;cid=1206&#038;MainCatID=12">GigaOm reports</a> Microsoft announced the Nokia 130 Monday, on sale for €19. The candybar styled handset runs Nokia OS and can play music and display videos on its 1.8-inch screen. 	http://gigaom.com/2014/08/11/microsoft-debuts-e19-phone-and-no-it-doesnt-run-windows-phone/<br />
Huawei told Shanghai’s China Business News that the company plans to phase out more than 80% of its low-end mobile phones in the second-half of this year. Huawei says the majority of low-end phones it makes are for carriers, not because of customer demand. Huawei intends to focus on branding its own models.	</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/11/us-china-mobilephone-xiaomi-idUSKBN0GB0WY20140811?feedType=RSS&#038;feedName=technologyNews">Reuters reports</a> Xiaomi rolled out a software upgrade Sunday to fix a loophole in its cloud messaging system that triggered unauthorized collection of data from user’s contacts. Xiaomi Vice President Hugo Barra apologized for the unauthorized data collection and said the company only collects phone numbers in users&#8217; address books to see if the users are online. The messaging system will be opt-in from now on and numbers sent to Xiaomi will be encrypted and not stored.</p>

Call from Dave in Orlando on Twitch	</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Tom &amp; Jennie,</p>
<p>The head-up display discussed on Friday was provided by my car manufacturer.  It really is very useful &#8211; showing my speed, turn-by-turn directions, etc. while keeping my eyes on the road.  I also have my phone connected through bluetooth which allows me to see and interact with a limited amount of information such as audio tracks and incoming calls.  And that&#8217;s it!  I can&#8217;t read texts or email nor would I ever want to.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing third party apps built into our cars (after all Waze is more accurate than my in-car sat nav), but there needs to be continued thoughtful consideration about what kinds of information drivers should be allowed to access.</p>
<p>Love the show!<br />
Dave&#8221;	</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/NateLanxon">Nate Lanxon</a></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b><br />
<span id="more-1836"></span></p>
<p>Wednesday <a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/08/china-refutes-claim-of-government-ban-on-apple-purchases/">Bloomberg reported</a> a Chinese procurement list drafted by the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission with the Ministry of Finance had dropped Apple products, meaning government money could not be used in China to buy them. ReCode reports that the list was only for energy-saving products and  China’s Central Government Procurement Centre, China’s finance ministry and Apple, all say the company never applied to be on the list in the first place. There are many government procurement lists in China and government money can still be used to purchase Apple products even if they are not on the energy-saving list. Apple products are certified as energy-saving in China but Apple has not applied to be included on that procurement list. 	</p>
<p>GigaOm <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/08/public-wi-fi-users-in-russia-will-have-to-log-on-with-id-under-new-information-war-order/">reports</a> that Russia’s Prime Minister has signed an order requiring users of public WiFi to register with a full name confirmed by personal identification. Simple. The Russian communications ministry clarified this only applies to hotspots set up by network operators. OK. Oh and also, Moscow’s IT chief claims it only applies access points provided by Russia’s postal service.  AND Izvestia reported hostspot operators must log hardware identifiers, keep it for 6 months, and register with the telecoms regulator. Simple.	</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2462220,00.asp?kc=PCRSS03069TX1K0001121&#038;utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ziffdavis%2Fpcmag%2Fbreakingnews+(PCMag.com+Breaking+News)">PCMag reports</a> the United States Patent and Trademark Office  has rejected multiple claims of Apple&#8217;s &#8217;172 autocomplete patent. <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2014/08/us-patent-office-rejects-apples.html">Apple can still provide more information</a> in its defense. However, Samsung alerted District Court Judge Lucy Koh of the decision as it affects claim 18 of the patent which Judge Koh had ruled Samsung had infringed. Samsung had been ordered to pay $119 million to Apple in the case.	</p>
<p>Twitch CEO Emmett Shear came away from his Reddit AMA <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/08/twitch-drops-highlight-limitations-enables-copyright-appeal-following-user-feedback/">with a few changes</a> for TWitch’s new policies on VOD and copyrighted music. Highlights, the only video that can be saved indefinitely under the new policy, can now be any length instead of being limited to two hours. Also, TWitch is deploying an appeal button to make it easier to dispute being flagged for copyrighted music. Under the new policy an entire 30-minute block of archived video would be muted if it’s flagged by Audible Magic’s system as infringing.	</p>
<p>And just a note here that <a href="http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/security/326238-required-viewing-dan-geer-s-black-hat-keynote-on-the-philosophy-and-future-of-the-internet">PC Mag’s Max Eddy</a> made special mention of a talk at Black Hat by security analyst Dan Greer called ‘Cybersecurity as Realpolitik.” The 55 minute talk is more philosophical than most Black Hat speeches and puts forth 10 suggestions for the future now that the Internet is no longer a hobby but a tool for the projection of power by governments.	</p>
<p><a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/08/alibaba-not-investing-in-snapchat/">ReCode reports</a> that the rumors of Alibaba’s investment in SnapChat can be dismissed. At least that’s the rumor they hear about the rumor. Recodes sources say talks did take place between the two companies but they have been over for a long time. Forbes reported Snapchat authorized the sale of 17.4 million preferred shares in a Delaware filing made Monday.	</p>
<p><strong>NEWS FROM YOU</strong><br />
habichuelacondulce posted the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-teams-up-with-google-on-encrypted-webmail/">CNET article</a> that Yahoo’s new Chief information security officer told Black Hat attendees  Thursday that Yahoo mail will be encrypted end to end sometime in 2015. The encryption will be compatible with Gmail’s, meaning email between the two services would truly be encrypted end to end. Yahoo will release their encryption source code sometime this fall. 	</p>
<p>Aractor pointed out the <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/library-congress-discovers-unreleased-duke-nukem-game/#!byqQJ6">Digital Trends article</a> about US congressional librarian David Gibson coming across a DVD-R that contained complete source code and assets for Duke Nukem: Critical Mass for the PlayStation Portable. The disc was found during inventory. A game of the same name was released for Nintendo DS in 2011 but Gibson says this PSP version is substantially different. The acquisition provides an unprecedented look into the design process.	</p>

&#8220;Hi Tom,</p>
<p>It occurred to me that uBeam is a modification of standard  audio equipment.</p>
<p>Microphones take sound waves and turn them into electrical signals that are then turned back into sound waves on the other end by the amplifier and speakers. We actually generate an electric current with our voices any time we speak into a microphone.</p>
<p>The brilliance of uBeam is that Ms. Perry realized she could put a mic into a device and use the current it generates to charge the battery. Like Fraser mentioned, efficiency is going to be important, but for devices like phones and maybe even laptops, something as low as 50% transfer rate might be enough.</p>
<p>uBeam is an exciting concept and I hope it pans out and becomes an open standard or at least readily available for licensing. If it turns into a proprietary technology I might cry.</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/fcain">Fraser Cain</a>, publisher of <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/">Universe Today</a></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ars Technica reports scientists from Cornell University and IBM Research have <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/08/ibm-researchers-make-a-chip-full-of-artificial-neurons/">designed a chip that mimics how the brain works </a>though an asynchronous collection of thousands of processing cores capable of spikes of activity and complicated connections just like neural networks. Computers have been able to model neural networks but the binary nature of transistors have limited the efficiency. This new processor, dubbed TrueNorth, uses the cores to receive and send to 256 other “neurons.” The power density of TrueNorth is 20mW per square centimeter and was fabricated by Samsung using a 28nm process. Next up, software!</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1828"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to ZDNet, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/google-gets-ball-rolling-on-fitness-wearables-with-fit-preview-sdk-7000032443/">Google has released a preview of its Android fitness platform to developers</a>. Google Fit, announced in June at Google I/O, will collect fitness activity from Android smartphones and wearables. Google says developers will be able to launch their apps when the SDK goes into general availability later this year through Google Play services for handsets, Android Wear and the web.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">ReCode reports <a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/07/facebook-privatecore/">Facebook announced Thursday it has acquired PrivateCore, a server security startup. </a>PrivateCore will help defend Facebook’s data centers from malware and other security breaches. PrivateCore’s founders and other members of the team will work at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters on the Facebook security team run by Joe Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/07/google-strengthens-web-encryption-drive-by-making-https-a-ranking-issue/">Google said late Wednesday it will start taking TLS connections, the secure URLS that begin with https:, into account in search engine rankings</a>. It will affect fewer than 1% of queries and carry less weight than other content signals. The move may encourage sites to provide secure connections to their webpages in order to help SEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Verge notes <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5976897/twitch-cracks-down-on-unlicensed-music-ahead-of-rumored-1-billion-buyout">Twitch has begun scanning archived video for copyrighted music and muting entire 30 minute chunks if such music is found</a>. Many games incorporate music and already high profile streams like the dota2 streams from Valve, maker of dota 2, have reportedly been muted. Twitch partnered with a company called Audible Magic for the scanning. The heavy-handed and often capricious nature of the policy reminds many of YouTube’s similar contentID system further fueling rumors that Google is acquiring TwiTch.<a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/07/under-fire-twitch-ceo-says-we-screwed-up-policy-announcement/"> Twitch CEO Emmett Shear said on Reddit Twitch has no intention of flagging songs due to original in-game music and will try to fix the problem</a> and stressed the no live streams will be scanned or blocked. Twitch also announced it will no longer allow videos to be archived forever, Making 14 days the maximum that video will be preserved. However you can push a button and have your archived videos saved— to YouTube.</span></p>
<p><b>News From You:</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MikePkennedy</strong> submitted the Verge article noting several reports that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/7/5977989/windows-9-virtual-desktops-no-more-charms-menu">Microsoft will get rid of the Charms bar from Windows 9. </a>That’s the devilish bar that you have to hover over to the right just right in order to access things like settings and shutdown. It works much better on touch screens than with a mouse. Windows 9 will also add an amazing Linux feature from the early 2000s known as ‘virtual desktops’. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>sdc111</strong> pointed out the Boing Boing post that <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/08/06/major-homeland-security-contra.html">USIS, a federal contractor that does background checks for the US DHS, disclosed Wednesday that federal employees’ personal data has likely been stolen. </a>USIS said the attack had “all the markings of a state-sponsored attack,” because reasons. The US FBI is investigating.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>diggsalot</strong> submitted the Android Police report that <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/08/06/t-mobile-is-now-the-uss-no-1-prepaid-provider-surpassing-sprint-if-you-count-metropcs/">T-Mobile claims it is now the number one pre-paid wireless provider in the United States. </a>The company reports it has 15.64 million pre-paid subscribers to Sprint&#8217;s 15.19 million. Pre-paid contracts are not generally considered as lucrative as customers can stop anytime. The real money is in &#8216;post-paid&#8217; subscribers&#8211;people locked into nice, predictable two-year prison sentences&#8211;er contracts. T-Mobile CEO John Legere predicts his company will overtake Sprint in overall subscribers by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And <strong>tm204</strong> passes along good news for European gamers from The Verge: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/7/5978423/xbox-one-digital-tv-tuner-features-release-date-pricing">Microsoft will release an over-the-air TV tuner/adapter for the European X-Box One</a>, allowing users to pass broadcast channels through the Xbox&#8217;s HDMI port. The device goes on sale in October in France Italy German Spain and the UK, and will cost 29,99 Euros. Microsoft has not yet committed to going full DVR, but users will be able to pause live television and get program listings. No word yet on when this technology will reach other regions of the world, so Australia, you just keep doin&#8217; what you do. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pick of the Day: <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.redcross.org/mobile-apps/first-aid-app">The Red Cross First Aid App </a>via Grant in beautiful Northern Ontario. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As a passenger train conductor, I am extensively trained in first aid. But, when an emergency pops up, I like to double check everything I am doing to make sure passengers are getting the best treatment possible. <a href="http://www.redcross.org/mobile-apps/first-aid-app">The Red Cross First Aid app </a>is amazing for this purpose. It makes finding emergencies quick and easy right on the home screen and keeps updating for any new techniques that may have been implemented since my last first aid class. It is available for different countries and is free.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Plug of the Day:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"> It&#8217;s Thursday, which means its time for another article+video combo from Molly Wood in The New York Times. This week Molly checks out three services competing to be the Netflix of Books. Check out <a href="nytimes.com/machinelearning">nytimes.com/machinelearning</a> to read up on e-books.</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p>Bloomberg reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-06/china-said-to-exclude-apple-from-procurement-list.html">ten Apple products, including iPads and MacBooks have been omitted from a Chinese government procurement list distributed in July. </a>The models had been included on the June list. Products not on the procurement list cannot be purchased with government money.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/5/5973485/samsung-and-apple-dropping-legal-disputes-outside-the-us">Apple and Samsung issued a joint statement Tuesday announcing the companies have “agreed to drop all litigation between the two companies outside the United States.” </a>The two US cases are the biggest with Apple winning the first with more than $1 billion in damages and a split decision in the second heavily in Apple’s favor with Samsung owing $119.6 million and Apple owing $158,400.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now that the folks at Lyft have made us feel *mostly* comfortable with the idea of riding in a stranger&#8217;s car because that car is wearing a pink mustache, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/08/06/lyft-launches-carpooling-strangers-service-lyft-line/">The Next Web reports Lyft is adding more strangers to the equation</a>. Lyft Line allows up to three solo passengers who share a common route to ride together. The company claims Line rides could be sixty percent cheaper. Yesterday Uber announced a ride-sharing experience called UberPool, so the arms race between the two companies remains in balance til at least tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Next Web reports that<a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/08/06/foursquare-launches-redesigned-mobile-app-focused-location-based-recommendations/"> Foursquare has officially relaunched its mobile app with a renewed focus on location-based recommendations. </a>The company introduced a new tagging system called &#8220;tastes&#8217; which gather initial input from the user and then use that data to suggest nearby establishments that fit your preferences. For those still smarting from the loss of their Foursquare mayoralties, the new app introduces the concept of experts&#8211;every time a user adds a tip, and every time that tip is saved or shared by another user, they gain expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The BBC reports <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28672121">Wikipedia has begin naming links that have been removed from European versions of search engines under the right-to-be-forgotten rules there</a>.

Wikimedia also issued its first transparency report about takedown requests. One involved a selfie taken by a macaque.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>biocow</strong> pointed out the Engadget story that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/05/sprint-tmobile/">Softbank has given up its efforts to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom and merge it with Sprint</a>. Regulatory approval proved to be too unlikely for CEO Masayoshi Son’s taste. Subsequently Sprint announced Sprint CEO Dan Hesse will step down August 11 and Marcelo Claure, the chief of wireless distributor Brightstar, will take over. Dish Network Chairman Charlie ERgen told analysts on an earnings call that now that Sprint is out of the picture, “T-Mobile is something that we would have an interest in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> pointed out<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5973729/the-problem-with-the-new-york-times-biggest-hack-ever"> the Verge article that pokes some holes in the report that Russian hackers had stolen email and passwords for 1.2 billion accounts covering 420,000 websites.</a> Among the reasons for skepticism is that Hold Security, which revealed the hack, is charging a $120-a-year subscription to check if your name and password are on the list. The technique to acquire the database involved buying names on the black market as well as SQL-injection attacks, which mostly affect small sites. Finally Russell Brandom points out the attackers responsible have been using their vast bounty to do Twitter spamming rather than something more lucrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>duxbak99</strong> submitted the Ars Technica story that r<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/08/whitehats-recover-victims-keys-to-cryptolocker-ransomware/">esearchers from FOX-IT and FireEye recovered private encryption keys to ransomware CryptoLocker </a>and have created a website at http://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/ that allows victims to unlock their computers without paying the $300 or so ransom. Victims must upload one of the files encrypted by CryptoLocker along with the e-mail address where they want the secret key delivered. KAPT_Kipper and magoojc also submitted links about this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> pointed out <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/08050906-todays-the-day-rosetta.html">the Planetary Society article about the arrival of European Space Agency probe Rosetta arriving at comet 67P/Chryumov-Gerasimenko becoming the first spacecraft to maneuver alongside a speeding body</a>. The comet is traveling at 55,000km per hour. The craft will study 67P from alongside and then in November, the Philae lander will put down on the comet’s surface to carry out closeup experiments. </span></p>

<p>Pick of the Day from Willie X. Gluck : <span style="color: #000000;">My pick is <a href="http://clipjump.sourceforge.net/">Clipjump</a>, a clipboard manager for Windows that has changed the way that I work (for the better!). It&#8217;s easy and intuitive to use in that it uses the usual copy and paste shortcut keys. Now I can copy multiple items that I will need to paste, switch, and paste them sequentially without the need to switch back-and-forth between applications. It also has a feature that will strip the formatting, allowing me to replace PureText, which was a great but single purpose app. I also like that you get a preview of what you&#8217;re going to paste. The developer also introduced plug-ins that do stuff like change case. There are also a bunch of other cool features.</span></p>
<p><strong>Plug of the day:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"> Like tech history? I&#8217;ve teamed up with Scott Johnson to put out monthly looks at what happened in history this month.

<p><b>Show Notes</b><br />
<strong>Today&#8217;s guests:  <a href="https://twitter.com/KenDenmead">Ken Denmead</a>, <span style="color: #000000;">Grand Nagus at <a href="http://geekdad.com/">GeekDad.com</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Not a good 24 hours for Samsung. First Canalys announces its data showed <a href="http://thenextweb.com/in/2014/08/05/samsung-displaced-indias-top-mobile-vendor-retains-lead-smartphone-shipments/">Xiaomi shipped just less tan 15 million smartphone units in China in Q2, taking the top spot away from Samsung which shipped 13.2 million in the country.</a> That was barely enough to stay in front of Lenovo. Then Counterpoint Research claims <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/05/us-xiaomi-china-idUSKBN0G50TE20140805?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">Micromax has passed Samsung in India to take the top spot in mobile phone market share with 16.6% for Micromax to Samsung’s 14%. </a>The good news for Samsung? They still hold the SMARTphone crown in India with 25.3% to Micromax’s 19.1%.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1808"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">None of the following is actually official. Techcrunch, citing a Re/Code report, says <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/05/apples-iphone-event-said-to-be-happening-sept-9/?ncid=rss">Apple has scheduled a &#8216;big media event&#8217; for Tuesday September 9th</a>, at which Apple is likely to unveil its next generation iPhone. Here&#8217;s what the rumor roundup has rustled so far: Phones with 4.7 inch screens, and possibly also another device with a 5.5 inch display. The new iPhone *may* use the new A8 processors, *could* be all metal, *might* have temperature and humidity sensors, and could *possibly* support for near-field communications. Bloomberg And Wall Street Journal are also reporting the September 9th date.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/05/us-blackberry-restructuring-idUSKBN0G50BM20140805">Blackberry has sent a memo to its employees saying restructuring is done and the company is back on track to be cash flow positive by the end of the year.</a> In other words, if you’re still working here, your job is safe for now. BlackBerry has cut its workforce by 60% over the last three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/05/live-streaming-pioneer-justin-tv-shuts-down-as-company-focuses-on-twitch/">Justin.TV has shut down after seven years</a>.  Existing members have until September 5 to transfer their accounts to Twitch. Archived video is not available. Justin had shut its archives down June 15. The company now solely exists as Twitch which had 50 million unique viewers in July and is rumoured to have agreed to sell to Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to Tom&#8217;s Guide, <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/navdy-price-specs,news-19267.html">a new device called Navdy can sit on your dashboard and project maps, images and text on to a 5 inch flip-up glass screen</a>. The projected image is transparent and appears to float six feet ahead of the driver, and I quote &#8220;so it doesn&#8217;t distract.&#8221; The device can pair with your smartphone to make calls and stream music, and plugs into a car&#8217;s OBD II port for power. Navdy will ship in early 2015 for pre-order price of $299, with future Navdy&#8217;s selling for $499. In their video, LonelySandwhich assured me its safe because pilots use a similar thing. Thanks Adam. The Daily Tech News Show is now accepting suggestions on how this could possibly be safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">ReCode reports <a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/05/microsoft-confirms-peggy-johnson-will-head-business-development/">Microsoft confirmed Tuesday it has hired former Qualcomm executive Peggy Johnson to head up business development</a>. Johnson will start Sept. 1 as executive VP of global business development, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Johnson was most recently heading global marketing and Qualcomm Labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ars Technica reports that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/08/paypal-2fa-is-easily-bypassed-teenage-white-hat-hacker-says/">17-year-old Joshua Rogers of Melbourne has discovered another way to spoof a browser cookie to bypass PayPal’s two factor authentication</a>. The procedure involves using the process that links eBay to Paypal accounts. An attacker would still need to know the victim’s userid and password. Rogers, a whitehat hacker, says he reported the vulnerability to PayPal June 5 but received no response. </span></p>
<p><b>News From You:</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>tm204</strong> submitted the MIT News post that <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804">researchers from MIT, Microsoft and Adobe will present findings at SIGGRAPH on how to reconstruct audio from video of certain objects</a>. One experiment recorded video of a potato chip bag from 15 feet away behind soundproof glass. An algorithm interprets minute vibrations on the bag to reconstruct the audio. While most of the experiments required high quality video of up to 6,000 fps to detect the vibrations, the researchers also figured out how to exploit sensors in 60fps consumer camera, to detect lower quality but still usable audio. None of the experiments could interpret the audio in real time. One capture took two hours to process. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Hurmoth</strong> posted the Ars Technica article that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/aereo-tells-court-its-bleeding-to-death-but-gets-no-relief/">Aereo is still fighting</a>. We know Aereo argues they should be allowed to pay the compulsory license to continue operating. Another argument asks permission to continue to provide recorded video since in oral arguments the Supreme court indicated that did not violate Plaintiffs&#8217; public performance rights. While US District Judge Alison Nathan rejected Aereo’s emergency motion on these arguments, she ordered both sides to file papers in support of their positions over the next five weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>SpydrChick</strong> pointed out the Dvice story that <a href="http://www.dvice.com/archives/2011/07/new-80222-wi-fi.php#more">the IEEE has released a new official standard for 802.22 that can cover 12,000 square miles. </a>The standard is designed to take advantage of spectrum from 54MHz to 698MHz opened up by the shutdown of analog TV. In theory the standard will supposedly be able to broadcast data at up to 22 Mbps 62 miles from a single base station over WRANs (wireless regional area networks).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MacBytes</strong> passes along an Engadget reports that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/04/daewoo-robotic-exoskeletons/">the DAWN OF THE ROBOTIC EXOSKELETON IS UPON US! Sort of.</a> South Korean carmaker Daewoo has been testing a robotic suit that allows shipyard workers carry objects as heavy as 66 pounds with ease by putting all the load on the machine at least for three hours the battery lasts. Daewoo hope that the exoskeleton will eventually hold up to 220lbs, just as soon as they figure out how to cope with slippery floors and twisting movements. So no moonwalking in the exoskeleton, people.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pick of the Day: <a href="http://pluto.tv/#!">Pluto.tv</a> via Chris</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hey Tom and Jennie, love the show. Just discovered <a href="http://pluto.tv/#!">pluto.tv </a>- a cool app to watch video online. Over a hundred curated channels in a nicely organized channel guide for that &#8220;lean back&#8221; experience. Now with chromecast support on Android, this is a nice pick for folks just looking for a variety of queued specialty content online. I can&#8217;t speak for the rights clearances or how these channels are legally vetted but I thought it was worth sharing&#8230; maybe something of interest for the cordkillers podcast as well.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Plug of the Day: </strong><span style="color: #000000;"> The Sword and Laser Anthology collects 20 amazing stories from new writers in the Sword and Laser book club audience. 10 SciFi and 10 fantasy stories with an introduction by Patrick Rothfuss.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to TechCrunch, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/its-official-square-acquires-food-delivery-service-caviar/">Square, the company that makes mobile credit card readers, has acquired food delivery service Caviar for a reported 90 million dollars in stock.</a> Square launched its own food-ordering service earlier this year, but only allowed customers to order food for pick-up. Caviar provides delivery for restaurants. Producer Jennie has done some research, and can confirm the ability to order an ounce of actual Osetra caviar from Caviar exists only in New York for now.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have more than 3,000 readers on your blog and you operate in Russia, you’ll need to register with telecommunications regulator Roskomnadzor under a new law. GigaOm passes along that Izvestia reports<a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/01/the-registration-of-russian-bloggers-has-begun/"> Roskomnadzor has sent its first batch of notices to bloggers who must also disclose their true identity, avoid hate speech,“extremist calls” and obscene language</a>.

<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>dan_linder</strong> submitted the Wired Uk story that <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/31/nasa-validates-impossible-space-drive">British scientist Roger Shawyer’s EmDrive may have got some validation from NASA</a>. The controversial drive allegedly converts electric power into thrust, without the need for propellant by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container. Critics say that violates the conservation of momentum. Last year a Chinese team replicated the results to little fanfare. Now US scientist Guido Fetta has built his own version of a microwave thruster, which NASA agreed to test at Johnson Space Center. The test results were presented on July 30 at the 50th Joint Propulsion Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. The drive produced 30 to 50 micronewtons of thrust. Small, but positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>the_big_endian</strong> wanted us to know that on the scrap heap of Google tech that includes Google Reader, Google Health and Knol, we should make room for&#8230;<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/31/nasa-validates-impossible-space-drive">the Google Barge</a>? The Next Web passes along the Portland-Press Herald report that the barge, which had been intended as a showroom for the Google X division, was towed into Portland Harbor last October, only to be sold to an international barging company. The four-story building built out of shipping containers will be dismantled. However a similar mystery barge docked in Stockton, California remains untouched. </span></p>

<p>Today&#8217;s guest: Patrick Beja!</p>
<p><strong>Headlines</strong></p>
<p>Ars Technica passes along the Wall Street Journal report that French Telecom Iliad, made an offer for T-Mobile USA, less than a week ago. Iliad would reportedly pay $15 billion in cash to buy 56.6% of T-Mobile USA. Softbank, owner of Sprint, also would like to acquire T-Mobile for something around $30 billion for the whole thing.</p>
<p><span id="more-1758"></span></p>
<p>And T-Mobile is only getting more valuable. In quarterly earnings posted Thursday, T-Mobile USA added 1.5 million customers, for the fifth straight quarter of subscriber gains more than a million. The company posted a net profit of $391 million, or 48 cents per share, boosted by a spectrum license deal with Verizon.</p>
<p>Wired reports researchers from Security Research Labs in Berlin will present a USB vulnerability at Black Hat next week. BadUSB is a hack that replaces a USB controllers chip making it virtually undetectable. Malware on a PC can compromise any USB connected device and likewise any infected USB device can compromise any computer it’s plugged into. That includes mice, keyboards, USB sticks and even cell phones. USB firmware is not code-signed making it easier to spoof.</p>
<p>GigaOm reports Mark Zuckerberg’s Internet.org foundation has introduced an app in Zambia that allows limited Internet access for free. Through a partnership with India’s Bharti Airtel, custmers can us an Android app or website to access services like Wikipedia, AccuWeater, Google Search, jobs portals, and Facebook Messenger among others, at no cost, except to the idea of net neutrality in Zambia possibly.</p>
<p>BBC reports Samsung’s profits fell 20% in Q2, hurt by slowing smartphone and tablet sales and a strong Korean Won. Samsung reported profit of 6.25 trillion won ($6.1bn; £3.6bn) down from 7.77 trillion won a year ago. The company warned that &#8220;prospects for growth remain unclear.”</p>
<p>Here’s why growth prospects might be unclear. Smaller device makers are eating Samsung&#8217;s lunch. The Next Web reports Strategy Analytics mobile marketshare numbers for Q2 show Samsung marketshare falling from 32.6% to 25.2% on declining shipments. Apple fella couple points to 11.9% despite rising shipments. The ones to watch are Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi, all jumping above 5%. LG fell from 5.2% to 4.9. Oh and all those phones run Android for the most part. Android now has 84.6% of the market up from 80.2% while every other OS fell.</p>
<p>Ars Technica reports good news for Sony as Quarterly earnings posted a profit of ¥69.7 billion (about $677 million) up nearly 97% from a year ago. The PS4 powered most of the turnaround sending the Game &amp; Network division from ¥16.4 billion (about $160 million) loss last year to a ¥4.3 billion (about $42 million) profit this time around. Spider-Man helped too as Sony Pictures film distribution more than doubled its earnings over last year. More revenue may be coming in through the PS4 as Sony launches it’s on demand PlayStation Now service in the US and Canada with a 100 titles available from $3 to $15 depending on the amount of time you want to play a title.</p>
<p>A friend passed along a press release from ViaWest, a large operator of data centers in North America. Seems Shaw, the only slightly-less-despised-than-Rogers cableco in Canada has purchased ViaWest for $1.2 billion. ViaWest is one of the largest privately held data centre infrastructure, cloud technology and managed IT solutions in North America, with 27 locations in eight states. For you US listeners, imagine Comcast buying a big chunk of the Internet it doesn’t already own and you get the picture.</p>
<p>The Verge reports on a Reuters report that the European Commission is preparing an anti-trust case against Google&#8217;s Android mobile platform. According to Reuters&#8217; sources, European regulators have sent questionnaires to telecom companies and phone manufacturers, to see if Google is pressuring them to use Android. Add this to the still unresolved European anti-trust suit over the the web giant&#8217;s search practices, and Google may soon be applying for the right to be forgotten by the European government.</p>
<p>GigaOm reports Microsoft lost a fight in US Federal Court in New York Thursday to prevent US law enforcement to access data held on servers in Ireland without requesting permission from the Irish government. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ruled the search warrant served requires Microsoft to hand over the data requested regardless of where it was stored. Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said Microsoft will promptly appeal.</p>
<p>News From You</p>
<p>Hurmoth sends along the Mashable report that FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has sent a letter to Verizon Wireless asking why the company will slow down the top 5% of unlimited plan users on its 4G LTE Networks. Wheeler wrote, &#8220;&#8216;Reasonable network management&#8217; concerns the technical management of your network; it is not a loophole designed to enhance your revenue streams.&#8221; All major US carriers throttle top users of their 3G networks. A recent GAO report found that wirless carriers find that data caps help ease congestion. The same report did not find that data caps helped ease congestion for wireline ISPs, but were used as revenue generators.</p>
<p>AllanAV sends along a CNET report that Royal College of Art graduate Julian Melchiorri has created the first man-made, biologically functional leaf. Yup it takes in carbon dioxide, water, and light and releases oxygen. In addition to creating some nice air for us to breathe here on Earth, the leaf could also create oxygen on long-duration manned space missions to Mars and beyond. When reached for comment, the photosynthetic organism said, &#8220;I am a leaf on the wind.&#8221; Too soon?</p>
<p>MikePKennedy posted the Engadget story that Tesla has signed a deal with Panasonic to help build the so-called Gigafactory which will attempt to make cheaper batteries for electric cars. Tesla will build the plant and maintain it, while Panasonic supplies the lithium cells, plant, machinery and manufacturing equipment. The Gigafactory is expected to produce 35GWh of cells and 50GWh of power packs by 2020.</p>

<p>Pick of the Day: Way of Life via Matt from Sweaty Sacramento</p>
<p>Matt from Sweaty Sacramento writes: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a productivity app suggestion that, like your show, I use every day. Way of Life is an iOS app that helps you build new habits by tracking them daily. It&#8217;s essentially an automated version of the Seinfeld productivity method which has helped me a great deal in building good habits and becoming hyper productive. You can track daily completion, take notes of each habit or task, and look at trends based on your collected data to help motivate you or figure out why you might be struggling. The app also offers Dropbox syncing, note exporting, and custom reminders for each habit or task. The free version allows up to 3 tasks or habits to be track, which is a great way to start testing this method out. I quickly found myself purchasing the full version with no limits and believe it is worth the price of $4.99</p>

<strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/lamarrwilson">Lamarr Wilson</a> of <a href="http://www.lamarrwilson.com/">all the funny</a>.  And also <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Let&#8217;s Hangout:</strong> Re/Code reports <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/30/google-sends-hangouts-to-work-enhances-chromebox-for-meetings/">Google changed Hangouts for businesses and Chromebox for Meetings today</a>. Users of Google Apps for Business will now get access to Hangouts without needing a G+ ID. Hangouts will allow up to 15 participants, and will interoperate with video conferencing from Blue Jeans and IntercCall. Starting in September, Dell will sell a version of Chromebox for Meetings with the ability to connect it to more than one display at a time and new management capabilities for administrators.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1751"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Come on, Mario:</strong> According to the BBC, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28565798">Nintendo reported a larger first-quarter loss than expected</a>, with a 9.9 billion yen loss (97 million USD), compared with an 8.6 billion loss (about 86 million USD) deficit a year earlier. Nintendo did sell 2.82 million copies of Mario Kart 8 during the quarter, but overall sales fell 8%. Nintendo said it expected new releases in the coming months to boost demand before the holiday shopping season. Hyrule Warriors to the rescue? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Oh, snap:</strong> Bloomberg reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-30/snapchat-said-in-funding-talks-with-alibaba-at-10-billion-value.html">China’s Alibaba is part of talks to provide another round of investment in SnapChat</a>. The financing would value SnapChat at $10 billion. Alibaba rival TenCent is already a small and quiet investor in SnapChat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fly, Cortana, be free!</strong> The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2014/07/30/microsofts-cortana-digital-assistant-coming-china-uk-canada-india-australia/">Microsoft announced its first update to Windows Phone 8.1 will release Cortana to roam across the world. </a>The voice-activated assistant will be launched as a beta in the UK and in China under the name Xiao Na. Alpha versions of Cortana will arrive in Canada, India and Australia. All the versions will be localized with spellings and pronunciation. The U.S. version will get new features like snooze times for reminders, impersonations and a hands-free mode. Folders are also coming to the home screen and VPN supports WiFi hotspots. Preview for Developers will get the update next week and the rest of us mere mortals will see it in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Spy vs. Spy, 2014:</strong> Apple Insider reports <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/30/russian-government-asks-apple-to-hand-over-source-code-amid-spying-concerns">Russia’s Ministry of Communications and Mass Media asked Apple and SAP to provide source code for inspection</a>. The government wants to make sure the code doesn’t hide any nefarious spy programs. Microsoft agreed to a similar proposal in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Assume the worst:</strong> Security Week reports <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/tor-warns-attack-attempting-deanonymize-users">The Tor Project disclosed details of an attack that attempted to deanonymize users.</a> The attack was detected on July 4 while Tor was trying to identify attacks leveraging a method discovered by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University&#8217;s CERT. Tor project leader Roger Dingledine believes the attack may have been conducted by the researchers as a test, but is frustrated because Tor can’t get access to the research. A talk on the topic was planned for Black Hat, but then was canceled at the request of the University. Dingledie advised that users who operated or accessed hidden services between February and July 4 should assume they have been affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>No seat drivers?</strong> GigaOm reports<a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/30/uk-driverless-car-trials-to-begin-within-months/"> the UK will permit driverless cars on British roads for testing starting in January 2015</a>. The trials will last between 18 months and 3 years. Tests are already taken place on public roads in Japan and parts of the US. Trials on Swedish roads begin in 2017. </span></p>
<p><strong>Whatevs, EA:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/07/sony-ea-access-wouldnt-provide-value-for-playstation-owners/">Wondering why EA Access only came to the Xbox One?</a> Ars Technica reports that a Sony representative told Game Informer that it essentially just wasn&#8217;t worth it. The unnamed Sony rep touted the 200% growth of PlayStation Plus memberships since the launch of PlayStation 4 saying, &#8220;We don’t think asking our fans to pay an additional $5 a month for this EA-specific program represents good value.&#8221; So, basically, take your early access to Madden 15 and shove it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Free data!</strong> GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/30/freedompop-starts-selling-tablets-with-free-data-and-voice-plans/">FreedomPop will begin selling first-gen iPad Minis and Samsung Tab 3s which will come with the service’s standard free 500 Megabytes a month as well as 500 SMS and 200 voice minutes</a>. Yes, you heard that right. You can make calls through FreedomPop’s voice app on your tablet. You can bring your own tablet on too, as long as it’s compatible with the Sprint LTE network that FreedomPop uses. The iPad mini will sell for $319 and the Tab 3 for $199.</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>melchizedek74</strong> posted the Ars Technica article that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/isps-tell-government-that-congestion-is-not-a-problem-impose-data-caps-anyway/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+All+content%29">a survey by the US Government Accounting Office came to the shocking conclusion that people don’t like data caps on home Internet service. </a>They also found that home Internet service providers admit that data caps aren’t really needed to prevent congestion. Instead data caps are needed in order to charge people more for Internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> submitted the Wired article the peers of the realm in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/30/right-to-be-forgotten-is-wrong">the House of Lords have, after weighty consideration, determined that the so-styled “right to be forgotten” as described by the European Commission is simply “wrong.</a>” The EU sub-committeee of the Lords consulted with the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office, Minister for Justice and Civil Liberties Simon Hughes and Google, before arriving at their inescapable conclusion. Chairman of the Sub-Committee Baroness Prashar said the reality was &#8220;crystal clear&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;neither the 1995 Directive, nor the Court of Justice of the European Unions&#8217;s (CJEU) interpretation of it, reflects the incredible advancement in technology that we see today, over 20 years since the Directive was drafted&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And finally, <strong>sdc111</strong> passed along the BoingBoing post of an NPR report that <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/07/29/scientists-investigate-radio-w.html#more-321393">astronomers at two different radio telescopes on opposite ends of the earth have now picked up fast &#8220;burst&#8221; radio signals that seem to originate outside our galaxy. </a>Now before you submit your bid to build the wormhole surfing machine based on the schematics that are surely embedded deep within the signal, responsible scientists would like to remind you that these radio bursts could caused by blitzars, pulses of energy from a supermassive star collapsing into a black hole. Or by powerful solar flares from closer stars. Or by something an equally wondrous and yet unknown natural phenomenon. OR ALIENS SCIENTISTS!</span></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day: Francisco Rivera picks <a href="testmy.net">testmy.net</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Forever, I&#8217;ve used speedtest.net by Ookla to check my connection. It&#8217;s pretty and all, but I&#8217;ve since found <a href="testmy.net">testmy.net </a>and it&#8217;s great, free, and allows for automatic repeat testing at almost any interval, which is great if you&#8217;re trying to find out if your service drops out at odd intervals.</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjohnson">Scott Johnson</a> of the <a href="http://frogpants.com/">Frogpants Network</a></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>No chat for you:</strong> TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/28/facebook-moving-messages/">Facebook is getting rid of messaging in the main Facebook app for iPhone and Android and will force users to download the separate “Messenger” app if they want to chat</a>. This is nothing new to European users who were the guinea pigs for the requirement back in April. Mobile web, iPad, feature phone, Windows Phone, Paper, and desktop users can still message like before, for now. Facebook believes the move will make both the Facebook and Messenger apps better.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1743"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Gamers rejoice:</strong> The Next Web reports<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/29/ea-announces-5-gaming-subscription-xbox-one/"> EA announced a new subscription service for the Xbox One today</a>. For $5 a month or $30 a year, members of EA Access can play older titles from the EA vault and get free access to new titles up to 5 days before release. After the release, you’ll still have to buy the game, but you get a 10% discount on all EA titles and DLC in the Xbox store. Plus, if you played early and buy the game any progress you made carries over. Selected users are participating in a beta, but EA promises to take everyone’s money soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>More of everything! For everyone!</strong> Is this good news or bad news for those hopeful of new MacBook pros this autumn? The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2014/07/29/apple-updates-macbook-pro-retina-display-lineup-faster-processors-memory/">Apple has done a minor refresh of the MacBook Pros with retina displays</a>. The 13-inch starter model comes with a 2.6 GHz Core i5 processor and 8GB of memory. The entry-level 15-inch MacBook Pro now starts with a 2.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 chip and 16GB of memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Speak into the microphone, please:</strong> ZDNet reports <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blackberry-acquires-secusmart-ups-voice-security-ante-7000032086/">BlackBerry said Tuesday it will acquire German mobile security company Secusmart</a>. The two companies have partnered since 2009. Secusmart makes popular anti-eavesdropping product. Or at least its become popular with Chancellor Merkel. The Secusmart Security Card contains the NXP SmartMX P5CT072 crypto-controller with a PKI coprocessor for authentication as well as a high-speed coprocessor that encrypts voice and data communication using 128 bit AES. All of that integrated into the micro-SD card.</span></p>
<p><strong>Smells like a bubble &#8230; :</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/29/sweet-smell-of-texting-technology-to-add-scent-to-mobile-messages/">Does the app boom smell like it’s ending?</a> Bear with me. In 1999, what’s big Websites Along came DigiScents which made a device called iSmell, I KID YOU NOT, that would allow web pages to emit odor. Within two years, dot-coms were bust. In 2005, AJAX, XML Web 2.0 was all the reage. Everyone’s Rubies were starting to ride Rails. And researchers from the University of Huelva developed XML Smell, a protocol of XML that could transmit smells. Within two years smartphones had wiped Web 2.0 out of our minds. Today with the app universe going strong, Vapor Communications is promoting an Indiegogo campaign for the iPhone. A device to let people send and receive scented messages. Woe betide its funding and the decline of the appiverse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Earnings:</strong> TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/twitter-skyrockets-after-reporting-big-q2-revenue-of-312m-profit-of-0-02-per-share/?ncid=rss">Twitter reported revenue of $312 Million and earnings per share of two copper pennies</a>. The street expected Twitter to lose the one pennie it did have on revenue of only 283.07 million Twitter allegedly said “TAKE THAT STREET WHAT DO YOU KNOW!” although that is unconfirmed. Twitter reported that it has 271 million monthly active users, up from its 255 million tally in the first quarter of 2014. That’s up 24%, year-over-year. Twitter’s monthly mobile user count was also up, to 211 million, a gain of 29%.</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> submitted the Ars Technica report that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/android-crypto-blunder-exposes-users-to-highly-privileged-malware/">researchers at Bluebox Security have discovered a hack that allows any malicious app to masquerade as an app with special privileges</a>. The vulnerability has existed since Android 2.1 in early 2010. Apps like Google Wallet and Adobe Flash are allowed to act with other apps in ways the Android sandbox usually prevents. While Android checks the apps ID it does not verify the validity of cryptographic certificates that accompany it. Cleverly made forgeries can therefore get the same special access to private information and device settings. Bluebox calls the vulnerability &#8220;Fake ID&#8221;. Google has been informed of the vulnerability and say they’ve issued a patch. Bluebox CTO Jeff Forristal will present more details on the vulnerability at Black Hat next week. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>metalfreak</strong> posted the PC World article noting the announcement over the weekend that Quantum Mechanix and Spark Plug Games will have the original cast of Firefly do the voicework for their upcoming Firefly game. Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Sean Maher, and Ron Glass have already recorded their bits. Jewel Staite, Gina Torres, and Summer Glau will be in the studio soon. The game will come to iOS, Android, PC and Mac in Spring 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> pointed us to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/28/liquid-hard-drives">a Wired UK article that researchers from the University of Michigan and New York University have been simulating wet information storage techniques which uses clusters of nanoparticles suspended in liquid</a>. Working a bit like a rubik’s cube, clusters of particles can reconfigure to represent different storage states. A 12-particle cluster can have almost 8 million states. That means a teaspoon of the stuff could store a Terabyte! All you have to do is use your scanning tunnelling microscope to read the data!</span></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:  <a href="www.proclipusa.com">ProClip</a> via Kevin Klecker</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Kevin Klecker has our pick of the day! My commute averages about an hour each way, and it would be much more torturous if I didn&#8217;t have The Daily Tech News Show to keep me informed and entertained. I always want my podcasts, music, and Waze at my fingertips, I never knew where to keep my phone until I stumbled onto <a href="www.proclipusa.com">ProClip</a>.</span></p>
<p>ProClip offers vehicle mounting solutions for all of your tech and gadgetry. ProClip is a 2-piece solution. It consists of a custom base that is engineered to fit your specific vehicle (You can choose one of several mounting locations. This is paired with either a universal/adjustable mount or custom mount which is engineered for your device (phones, tablets, 2 way radios, GPS units, etc). They have mounts to fit a large variety of device (iPhones, iPads, Galaxy series, heck&#8230;.even my Windows Phone 8 Device). Most have the option to include a hardwired charger, or a cigarette lighter adapters to automatically charge your device while docked. They are fairly easy to install (usually lock into vents or molding), and have always seemed sturdy. Since the system is 2 pieces, it is easy to replace the base if you get a new vehicle &#8211; or the mount if you get a new device. My wife and I will be customers for life!</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>China doesn&#8217;t like Windows 8, either:</strong> GigaOm compiles reports from Reuters and the South China Morning Post that <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/28/chinese-authorities-raid-several-microsoft-offices/">Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu have been visited by authorities</a>. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce is investigating the company. Chinese authorities banned government institutions from using Windows 8 in late May. Microsoft said Monday the company is “happy to answer the government’s questions.”<br />

<p><span id="more-1734"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lawsuits yay!</strong>TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/28/apples-beats-acquisition-gets-approval-from-the-european-commission/?ncid=rss">the European Commission has given Apple permission to acquire Beats Electronics</a>. The approval was predicated partly on the fact that beats has a very small marketshare in Europe for both headphones and digital music. Apple still needs approval in the SU, which it is expected to get. Then it can take on Bose, which is suing Beats for patent infringement. And come on, you know Apple lawyers love a good patent-infringement case, amiright?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Musical chairs, Mozilla style:</strong> Mozilla chair Mitchell Baker announced Monday that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/07/28/chris-beard-named-ceo-of-mozilla/">interim CEO Chris Beard has been appointed permanently as CEO of Mozilla Corporation</a>. Beard joined Mozilla in 2004, left for Greylock Partners in July 2013 and re-joined Mozilla in April of this year when CEO Brendan Eich was removed in controversy over his support of Proposition 8 in California. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>For realz, he&#8217;s totally your type, gurl:</strong> The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/28/5945061/okcupid-experimented-on-users-defends-facebook">OKCupid co-founder Christian Rudder has admitted that his site experimented on users as well</a>. In one of three described experiments, users were told they were good matches for people they were bad matches for in order to measure the change int he rate of correspondence. Being told you were a good or bad match did have an impact, but did not fully offset the calculated compatibility. Users were informed after the fact that they were part of the experiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Hi, Front Desk? I lost my phone.&#8221;</strong> The Verge reports that<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/28/5944499/smartphones-will-unlock-doors-at-hilton-hotels"> most Hilton-owned hotels worldwide plan to allow customers to use a smartphone to unlock their rooms by the end of 2016</a>. Hilton also plans to allow guests to check themselves in and choose their own room locations.</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ayserk56</strong> posted the Engadget story that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/27/lithium-anode-battery/?ncid=rss_truncated">researchers at Stanford have developed a new lithium battery that uses a nanoscopic carbon shield to allow for denser more efficient lithium use in a batteries anode</a>, the part that discharges electrons. The result is a battery that lasts considerably longer, won&#8217;t decay quickly and remains relatively safe. They estimate the battery could get 2-3 times the life of current cell phone batteries. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> sent along the <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/27/apple-to-buy-radio-app-swell-for-30-million/">ReCode report that Apple is close to buying Swell, an app that plays podcasts and other talk shows in a Pandora style</a>, that surfaced shows adapted to the listeners tastes. Swell will apparently be shut down this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>metalfreak</strong> pointed out the OS News story that <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/27862/Trend_Micro_caught_lying_about_Android_security">Trend Micro’s report that Android is populated with many fake apps, half of which are malware, turns out to be an exaggeration</a>. Techrepublic and Android Police both uncovered that Trend Micro’s promotion of their report didn’t work very hard to make clear that the fake apps in question did not exist in the Google Play store but had to be side-loaded, meaning a user had to ignore and disable security warnings to make the apps work.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> posted the Verge article that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/27/5942781/amazon-may-be-going-after-square-with-a-credit-card-reader-of-its-own">Amazon appears to be going after Square</a>. 9to5 Mac showed off internal documents from Staples indicating an “Amazon Card Reader” will arrive on store shelves August 12 for $9.95 right next to Square and Staples’ own payments dongle.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>geewhipped</strong> submitted the Vice article detailing disclosures that reveal<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-judges-approving-nsa-surveillance-requests-keep-buying-verizon-stock-725"> 3 US FISA Court Judges own Verizon stock, two purchasing it within the last year</a>. That includes Judge James Zagel who signed off on a government request to renew ongoing metadata collection in June. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And Ek sent us a report from Scouting the Refs.com detailing <a href="http://scoutingtherefs.com/2014/07/4052/tim-peels-twitter-account-waved/">the rise and fall of NHL official Tim Peel’s Twitter account</a>. Turned out Mr. Peel was excited to reach out to fans and put a human face on Referees, but he hadn’t read the rules closely. The NHL-NHLOA Collective Bargaining Agreement forbids officials from having have social media accounts. His time on Twitter was brief but burned brightly. We will miss you @TimTpeel</span></p>

All info will be anonymized and used only for health-related purposes though it will not be shared with insurance companies. Google will see benefits for the development of its wearable devices.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1726"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/25/lyft-nyc-take-two/?ncid=rss">Lyft will begin operations in all five boroughs of New York City, not just Brooklyn and Queens, starting at 7 PM tonight.</a> After negotiations with the New York Attorney General and the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Lyft will license all its drivers through the Taxi and Limousine Commission in NYC and pause operations in Buffalo and Rochester while it works to comply with insurance requirements there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A Google representative confirmed to CNET on Friday that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-granting-majority-of-right-to-be-forgotten-requests/">the company removed more than 50 percent of &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; requests it processed so far</a>. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that information Thursday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/25/5936843/house-passes-phone-unlocking-bill">The US House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill today legalizing cell phone unlocking. </a>The bill will allow consumers and third-parties to legally unlock phones that were received through a carrier. The US Senate passed the bill earlier this year, and President Obama is expected to sign it into law. Today&#8217;s legislation will not permanently allow legal phone unlocking. The rule will be reconsidered by the Library of Congress once again in 2015 and every three years thereafter unless circumstances should change.</span></p>

A series of edits described as “disruptive” were revealed on the Twitter account @congressedits that tracks edits made from Congress IP addresses.

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Guest: Tim Stevens, editor-at-large at cnet.com</p>
<p><strong>HEADLINES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Them whippersnappers are nippin&#8217; at yer heels:</strong> IDC released its estimate for the worldwide tablet market for the second quarter of 2014. <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/tablet_growth_losing_steam_large_screen_smartphones_2014">49.3 million tablets were shipped, an 11% rise over last year although a decline of 1.5% from Q1. </a>While Apple&#8217;s shipment and market share declined, it still leads with 26.9%, followed by Samsung, whose tablet market is also declining to 17.2%. The rise in the market is powered by the smaller tablet makers Lenovo, Asus and Acer in that order, although a whopping 44.4% of the market comes from tablets made by even smaller producers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1716"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pay up, Sony:</strong> Remember <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/07/sony-to-pay-up-to-17-75-million-in-2011-psn-hacking-settlement/">the great Sony PlayStation Network outage of April 2011</a>? Well, Ars Technica reports Sony has agreed to a court settlement in the Southern District of California that could hold it liable for up to $15 million in damages, plus nearly $2.75 million in attorney fees. What does it mean for you? A free downloadable PS3 or PSP game (from a selection of 14 titles), three PS3 themes (from a selection of six), or a three-month subscription to PlayStation Plus. You have to pick one if you already took part in the &#8220;Welcome Back&#8221; promotion back in 2011, otherwise you can choose two. If you’re identity was compromised as a result of the breach, Sony will pay up to $2,500. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Too. Much. Data.</strong> Re/Code reports<a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/24/hp-makes-50-million-strategic-investment-in-hortonworks/"> HP will invest $50 million in Hortonworks</a>, the Hadoop startup spun out of Yahoo. Big Data is a big problem for big companies. Hadoop is open source technology designed to make it easier to work with large collections of data in a distributed computing environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Happy birfday, Chromecast:</strong> One year ago today, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/24/chromecast-turns-one-why-this-small-streaming-stick-became-such-a-big-deal/">Google unleashed the Chromecast dongle on the world out of nowhere</a>. Users have pressed the cast button on an app 400 million times since that day. Chromecast is now available in more than 30,000 stores worldwide, and repeated that more than 6,000 developers have signed up.</span></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a go for shipping: </strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/24/oculus-begins-shipping-its-next-generation-developer-kit/">Oculus has begun shipping its DK2 virtual reality headset for developers</a>. The DK2 costs $350 and is not a consumer version of the hardware, but a refined version of the Crystal Cove headset that won a Best of CES award. It features lower latency, a low persistence OLED screen and positional tracking as well as simplified cords. Oculus plans to ship 10,000 DK2 units in July, though as of April it had sold 25,000 headsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;You&#8217;re walking too slow&#8221;:</strong> The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/07/24/razers-sub-100-nabu-wearable-device-integrates-wechat-behaves-much-like-smartwatch/">Razer’s Nabu smartband will integrate WeChat alongside the usual fitness tracking applications</a>. Messages could show up on the band’s screen, but apparently things like ‘high five to exchange contact info’ might also be in the works. Nabu will debut in international markets over the next few months and make it to China before the end of the year. It’s meant to retail for less than $100. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Color me surprised:</strong> The Telegraph has a look at <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/10987902/Less-than-third-of-Twitters-staff-is-female.html">Twitter’s new diversity report which reports 30% of the company’s workforce is female</a>. That’s the same as Google, 1 percent worse than Facebook and 7% behind Yahoo. The drag on balance comes from Twitter’s tech division which is 90% male and leadership which is 79% male. Twitter&#8217;s also revealed that 59 per cent of its global workforce was white, 29 per cent Asian. Less than 7% are Black, Hispanic, Latino or other.</span></p>

It takes place between &#8220;Halo 4&#8243; and &#8220;Halo 5: Guardians.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>jeff_rose</strong> submitted the Engadget report that<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/23/google-voice-offers-web-based-calls-through-hangouts-no-g-prof/"> you can now place phone calls directly from the Google Voice website using hangout. </a>You don’t need to have enabled hangouts in Gmail or even have a G+ account. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Inge_Aning</strong> pointed us to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529386/super-dense-computer-memory/">the MIT Technology Review article on Resistive Random Access Memory that could let you score ten to a hundred times as much data on a smartphone</a>. RRAM already is being developed by several companies, but researchers at Rice University have shown how to make it easier and cheaper at room temperature and with lower voltage. RRAM stores bits using resistance and retains data without power just like Flash memory. It can operate a hundred times faster though, and can concentrate a terrabyte into the space of a postage stamp. The new method uses a layer of silicon dioxide poked full of holes, sandwiched between thin layers of metal. </span></p>

<p>Pick of the Day: Autohotkey via Conrad Lawrence</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a> for PC. On the surface it is a hotkey generator, capable of reading abbreviations or key combinations and outputting long strings of text or data. For example type in &#8220;dtns&#8221; and get &#8220;Daily Tech News Show&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Beneath the surface though, it is an easy to learn scripting language capable performing long, complex operations using data from a variety of sources, including user input. To easily enter this data and view the results Autohotkey also allows the creation of GUI windows.</p>
<p>I work in the Test Department of a hardware/software tech company, and in the year or so since discovering Autohotkey, I have created dozens of custom GUIs designed to facilitate testing and increase productivity. A signature check of almost 60 modules would once take hours. I can now perform the same task in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Autohotkey is fully documented and supported at <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">http://www.autohotkey.com/</a> and it can be downloaded for free for both personal and commercial use. It does not require a compiler but includes one so that applications can be shared with PCs where Autohotkey is not installed.</p>

<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/acarboni">Anthony Carboni</a>, of <a href="http://wehaveconcerns.com/">wehaveconcerns.com</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How you like them apples, beta testers?</strong> PC Mag are among the folks reminding us that <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2461265,00.asp">Apple’s public beta of OS X Yosemite begins tomorrow</a>. The first 1 million people who signed up at <a href="https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram" target="_blank">appleseed.apple.com</a> will get a link to download the beta and be asked to submit feedback if/when they run into problems. Yosemite has been available to developers and will be finished and available to all later this autumn.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1708"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doggone it, Satya</strong>: ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley points out a passing comment Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made in the company’s earnings call yesterday regarding the mythical ‘One Windows’ strategy. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/what-one-windows-really-means-and-doesnt-7000031917/">Nadella said MS will, “streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for screens of all sizes.” </a>Later in the call, he clarified this meant one team developing all variants built off the NT core with a unified store and developer platform. It does not mean you can install the same copy of Windows on your phone as on your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Wait. Where am I?</strong> Anthony! Anthony! Anthony! Did you hear! <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/07/23/foursquare-changes-logo-offers-early-look-redesigned-app-coming-couple-weeks/">Foursquare has a new logo that looks kind of like a superhereo and is a rosy shade of pinky russet.</a> And the typeface! Its a darker blue! And there’s a new navigation bar at the bottom! And there’s more photos and recommendations. And it’s really confusing if you still want to check in because that button is hidden and only shows up if you have Swarm installed. And it’s coming in a couple weeks to Android and iOS! Are you excited?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ooooh, pretty:</strong> The Next Web reports Microsoft announced <a href="http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/07/23/microsoft-launches-114-lumia-530-4-inch-display-hits-europe-next-month/">the Lumia 530 arriving at the beginning of August in Europe for €85 BEFORE tax and subsidies</a>. The low-end Lumia has a 4-inch 854&#215;480 screen and runs Windows Phone 8.1 on a 1.2GHz Snapdragon. You can also select from one of many brightly colored interchangeable shells! Well, three of the colors are bright if you consider &#8220;white&#8221; to be bright. They’re bright orange, bright green, grey or white. The 530 will also be available in single and dual SIM versions. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Party in Helsinki!</strong> VentureBeat reports <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/23/google-buys-3d-graphics-startup-drawelements-for-over-10m/">Google has purchased Helsinki’s own 3D graphics startup DrawElements for an unofficial $10 million according to Arcticstartup</a>. DRawElements tech lets developers test various GPUs across mobile devices. That should be handy for Android devs at Google one might think. Also, it will be party time in Finland as the management team will move to Mountain View while the rest of the team will be left to create a worker’s paradise in Helsinki.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8216;But I saved your message &#8230; ohhhh&#8217;:</strong> Messaging app <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/line-launches-hidden-chats-new-feature-allows-users-to-send-time-limited-messages-2014-07-23">LINE announced a new ‘Hidden Chats’ feature for Android and iOS users that lets users send messages with a time limit attached for more ephemeral private conversations</a>. Time limits can be set from 2 seconds up to 1 week. Bloggers are now working furiously to post how-tos describing ways to subvert the feature and keep the ephemeral messages anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Zuck is even richer:</strong> TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/facebook-q2-2014-earnings/">Facebook beat earnings projections with 2.91 Billion in revenue and earnings per share of 42 cents</a>. Analysts expected revenue of 2.81 billion and earnings per share of .32 cents. Facebook reported 1.07 billion monthly MOBILE users and 654 million DAILY mobile users. 62% of its ad revenue came from mobile. Facebook now has 1.32 billion monthly users and 829 million daily users. Facebook’s total user count is up 3.125% from Q1. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Earnings:</strong> Reuters reports that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/23/us-at-t-results-idUSKBN0FS27Z20140723?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">AT&amp;T announced that its quarterly revenue rose, but slightly less than Wall Street forecasts. </a>AT&amp;T earned $3.6 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $3.8 billion, or 71 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose to $32.6 billion from $32.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>metalfreak</strong> posted the Wired article calling attention to the fact that <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/marvel-comics-unlimited/">Marvel is selling one month of access to its online comics archive for 99 cents.</a> That gives you access to more than 15,000 digital comics from the golden age to the halcyon days of 6 months ago. The service is usually $10 a month or $69 for a year. The 99 cent offer ends in one week. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>eean</strong> submitted the Ars Technica story that<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/deaf-advocacy-groups-to-verizon-dont-kill-net-neutrality-on-our-behalf/"> Verizon has been opposing net neutrality rules partly under the argument that so-called fast lanes could be used to make more accessible services fro blind, deaf and disabled users</a>. Several groups who lobby for accessibility filed comments asking the FCC not to let Verizon speak for them, writing &#8220;In no case should accessibility considerations form a basis for permitting paid prioritization more broadly, and the Commission should reject any overture to the contrary,” wrote the Telecommunications for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Inc.; the National Association of the Deaf; the Hearing Loss Association of America; Deaf and Hard of Hearing Consumer Advocacy Network; and Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Telecommunications Access. The American Association of People with Disabilities also wrote to oppose allowing paid prioritization.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>exfig</strong> pointed out the Verge posting that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5927879/japan-pm-shinzo-abe-wants-robot-olympics-2020">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said &#8220;In 2020 I would like to gather all of the world&#8217;s robots and aim to hold an Olympics where they compete in technical skill.&#8221;</a> Tokyo will be hosting the allegedly unenhanced human Olympics that same year. Switzerland plans to host games for athletes with robotic prosthetics in 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>spsheridan</strong> posted the Scientific American article on China’s planned supercollider. Scientists at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing, working with international collaborators, want to build a 52-kilometer electron-positron collider by 2028. It would be used as a ‘Higgs factory’ allowing the Higgs boson to be studied with greater precision than can be achieved at the smaller Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</span></p>

<p><strong>Picks of the Day: <a href="www.scottevest.com"><span style="color: #000000;">Scottevest</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> via Russell Manthy</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> A couple of weeks ago <a href="www.scottevest.com">Scottevest</a> was mentioned in passing on DTNS and thought it might be a good pick of the day. Scottevest was founded by Scott Jordan in 2000. He had noticed a problem early on that people were carrying more and more gear, gadgets, chargers, etc. and that the only vests on the market with pockets enough were designed for fishing or photography. Scottevest sells ‘technology enabled clothing’ which has pockets which are tailored especially for your gear. Some pockets have translucent touch sensitive lining so that you can operate your smart phone while not taking it out, others are RFID shielded. In addition to smaller pockets there are also bigger pouches for tablets and cameras. Wire ways are also provided for lacing wires for headphones from a device in a pocket to the collar. The vests and jackets are engineered to balance the load so that the clothes do not hang on you oddly. From the outside you would think they were normal vests or jackets but on the inside they are really great for keeping all your gear organized and concealed. I have been using one through fall and winter for the last few years and it is great; I actually miss it in the summer!</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/mollywood">Molly Wood</a>, of <a href="nytimes.com/machinelearning">the paper of record! </a></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Another wearable to track your &#8220;fitness&#8221;:</strong> Techcrunch reports Xiaomi announced a new phone called<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/mi-4-mi-band/?ncid=rss"> the Mi4 and a wearable called the Mi Band. </a>The wristband device is a fitness tracker and can unlock your mi phone, coming in 5 colors and will sell for 79 renminbi or about US$13. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/07/22/xiaomi-unveils-new-flagship-smartphone-mi-4/">The Mi4 has a metal band reminiscent of the iPhone </a>with a 5-inch 1080p display 2.5GHz processor snapdragon 801, 3GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage and a 3,080 mAh battery. It’s also the first model with LTE. TNW reports the Mi 4 will be available for CNY 1,999 (approximately $322) for the 16GB and CNY 2,499 (around $403) for the 64 GB. 3G versions come July 29 (China Unicom) and August (China Telecom), while the 4G version will land some time in September. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1700"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Even more wearables!</strong> Apple Insider posted that <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/22/apple-granted-comprehensive-itime-smartwatch-patent-with-in-strap-circuitry-arm-gesture-support">the USPTO granted Apple a patent for a “wrist-worn electronic device and methods therefore&#8221;</a> The device can connect with portable devices and the strap carries sensors. It also supports wrist gestures and proximity-sensing circuitry. Prior art? Never heard of it. Apple Insider points out the patent seems to be as much about putting an iPod Nano in an enhanced wristband as anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Not THAT kind of POS:</strong> TechCrunch started the wave of tech news sites noticing that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/amazon-quietly-launches-its-consumer-facing-mobile-wallet-app-amazon-wallet/?ncid=rss">Amazon had quietly launched a wallet app on July 17th for Kindles and Android</a>. The app lets you store gift cards and loyalty cards and in some cases check balances. You can manage the app at amazon.com/wallet which also will list your Amazon-linked credit cards, implying that someday those too may become available in the wallet app. Amazon says the current app is in beta and will ship pre-installed on the Amazon Fire Phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Games on:</strong> Ars Technica passes along the Nvidia announcement of<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/nvidia-to-launch-8-shield-gaming-tablet-and-wi-fi-controller-on-july-29/"> a new version of the Shield Android gaming tablet. </a>The previous all-in-one unit becomes the Shield Portable while the new unit is an 8-inch 1920 x 1200 tablet that can be controlled with a WiFi connected controller sold separately. The tablet includes 2GB of RAM, 300Mbps 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and 5MP front and rear cameras. It also supports 4K video through its micro-HDMI port. The tablet will sell for $299 at 16GB and $399 at 32GB with LTE. Controllers will cost an extra $59 and a cover-case is $39. All of that arrives on July 29 in the US and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Here come the lawyers:</strong> Ars Technica reports researchers from Carnegie Mellon University <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/is-tor-truly-anonymising-conference-cancelled">Alexander Volynkin and Michael McCord had to cancel a talk at Black Hat that would have shown how to discover the identity of Tor users for less than $3,000</a>. Attorneys from Carnegie Mellon and the Software Engineering Institute requested the cancellation. Tor project leader Roger Dingledine wrote in an e-mail to Tor users that a fix is coming that should close the particular bug in question. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Earnings:</strong> CNET reports <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-tops-q2-expectations-as-tablet-demand-drives-growth/">Verizon posted Q2 profits of $4.32 billion, down from last year’s $5.2 billion</a>. But Verizon&#8217;s share of the profit, after excluding the cut that Vodafone used to get as part owner, was actually $4.2 billion, or $1.01 a share, up significantly from a year-ago gain of $2.2 billion, or 78 cents a share. Revenue rose 5.7 percent. Verizon&#8217;s customer growth was attributed to tablet demand as well as net addition of 304,000 phone subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Crank it up:</strong> The Wall Street Journal reports sources say<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/apple-suppliers-gear-up-for-large-screen-iphones-1405985788-lMyQjAxMTA0MDIwMTEyNDEyWj"> Apple is asking suppliers to manufacture between 70 million and 80 million units two iPhone models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays by December 30</a>. Either phone could go on sale well before that date. Foxconn and Pegatron plan to start mass producing the 4.7-inch iPhone model next month and Hon Hai will reportedly begin making the 5.5-inch version exclusively in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Earnings:</strong> Microsoft reported Q4 revenue of<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/microsoft-reports-23-38b-fq4-revenue-including-2b-in-phone-top-line-misses-with-eps-of-0-55/?ncid=rss"> $23.38 billion with earnings per share of 55 cents. </a>TechCrunch reports analysts expected the company to earn $0.60 on revenue of $23.00 billion. It sold 5.8 million Windows Phone-based Lumia handsets in the period. Phones cost the company $0.08 in earnings per share and lost it $692 million in the quarter. Devices and consumer segment revenue were up 42% and commercial revenue up 11%. So in the end, more revenue, less profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/22/apple-q3-earnings-2014/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Earnings:</strong></span> Apple reported revenues of $37.4 billion for its third fiscal quarter and profits of $7.7 billion</a>, or $1.28 per share. Wall Street was expecting the company to announce earnings of $1.23 a share, on $37.99 billion in revenue. The results are right in the middle of Apple&#8217;s own revenue forecast, which was between $36 and $38 billion. 35.2 million iPhones shipped, versus 31.2 million a year ago 13.2 million iPads shipped, versus 14.6 million last year and 17 million the year before that 4.4 million Macs shipped, compared to 3.8 million last year</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kylde</strong>, the self-described janitor of the subreddit, whose tireless efforts keep it spam free pointed out the daily dot post about a decision U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/gmail-warrant-probable-cause-judge/">allow law enforcement officials access to a suspect’s entire email account without limit</a>. The judge placed no limits on the time frame or manner of search, which is unusual when approving a search warrant. The decision contrasts with one made by Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola, in March, blocking an attempt by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to obtain what he saw as an overly broad search warrant for an email account. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>melchizedek74</strong> submitted the Verge report that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/21/5923403/fxx-will-marathon-the-entire-simpsons-series-next-month-before">FXX cable channel will marathoin the entire run of the Simpson’s, all 25 seasons, from August 21st to September 1st</a>. After THAT, Variety reports that FXX will launch &#8220;Simpsons World&#8221; in October, which will let cable subscribers watch every episode on demand at SimpsonsWorld.com, or on the FXNow app.</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Picks of the Day:<a href="https://ifttt.com/"> </a>iSmoothRun &amp; Smashrun via Neil</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mr. Merritt, Here are two picks in the category of fitness (primarily running, but<a href="http://www.ismoothrun.com/"> iSmoothRun</a> does work well with bicycling too).</span></p>
<p>iSmoothRun &#8212; how I collect my GPX run data and view on my phone<br />
The best running application for iOS devices, in my opinion, is iSmoothRun.It doesn&#8217;t hold your GPX data hostage like some competitor applications, and makes it easy for you to share your data (I can export all, not just one at a time). I can also link it to many sites (including those that would be considered competitors). It has feature that no other running application has (or at least I have found) &#8230; It is only $5.99 and is the best money I have spent on my staying fit and healthy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://smashrun.com/">Smashrun.com </a>&#8211; how I analyze my GPX run data on my computer</span></p>
<p>I use multiple sites to track and share my runs. This site has become my favorite. It has a good social aspect as well as provided a lot of details into your various runs. It is actually the first running or application with badges that are actually encouraging and worthwhile (IMHO). The ability to summarize my running data is great. The pro features allow me to do a deep dive into a run and see my pace, heart rate, and elevation along the entire course. Considering how new of offering this is, it is very impressive. Also, the blog posts show the upcoming feature set based on votes from those that are using smashrun.</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD">Marques Brownlee</a>, aka MKBHD, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MKBHD">web video producer</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Keep calm and don&#8217;t panic:</strong> ZDNet reports <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/forensic-scientist-identifies-suspicious-back-doors-running-on-every-ios-device-7000031795/">Jonathan Zdziarski gave a talk at the HOPE/X conference Friday called “Identifying Backdoors, Attack Points, and Surveillance Mechanisms in iOS Devices.</a>” in which he did that. Zdziarski identified undocumented services that access user data with no reasonable explanation. He said, “Your device is almost always at risk of spilling all data, since it’s almost always authenticated, even while locked.&#8221; Even so, he wrote on his blog “DON’T PANIC,” noting that these are not security vulnerabilities. He wants Apple to explain and disclose the services and correct the problem. He wrote on his blog, “I want these services off my phone. They don’t belong there.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1693"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Save me for later:</strong> TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebook-save-feature/">Facebook launched a &#8220;read it later&#8221; feature for its website and iOS and Android apps, called &#8220;Save</a>.&#8221; It lets you save links from the News Feed and certain Facebook Pages to a list where you can view them later. In the News Feed, the &#8220;Save&#8221; button is in the drop-down menu accessed from the arrow in the top right of each story. On pages, it’s next to the &#8220;Like&#8221; button. You can access your saved list in the Web homepage’s left sidebar list of bookmarks, and the More apps list on mobile.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Faster! Faster!</strong> Ars Technica reports <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/verizon-fios-finally-symmetrical-upload-speeds-boosted-to-match-download/">Verizon is getting symmetrical, increasing upload speeds on its FiOS service to match download speeds with no increase in current charges</a>. New customers get the service right away and the increases will roll out to existing customers throughout the autumn. Customers who enroll in Verizon’s new rewards program will get first access. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;And China&#8217;s getting LARGER&#8221;:</strong> The Next Web passes along a report from the China Internet Network Information Center shows <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/07/21/in-china-more-people-now-access-the-internet-from-a-mobile-device-than-a-pc/">Chinese users accessing the Internet by mobile grew 83.4 percent as of June 2014, passing the percentage of users who access the Internet by PCs</a> (80.9 percent) for the first time. Overall number of Internet users in China is growing although not as fast as before. 46.9% of China uses the Internet up 1.1% from the end of 2013. Shopping and messaging are two of the most popular activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sainsbury goes green:</strong> Engadget reports t<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/21/sainburys-cannock-waste-electricity/?ncid=rss_truncated">he Sainsbury supermarket chain in the UK is powering its store in Cannock, West Midlands entirely with bio-methane gas generated from waste foods</a>. Sainsbury&#8217;s gives any food from its stores that can&#8217;t be used by charities or fed to animals to waste specialists Biffa, which uses microbes to turn it into gas. The program generates enough energy to power 2,500 homes and will come completely off the grid for its day-to-day energy consumption. </span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>AllanAV</strong> posted a link to Comcast’s page on OpenSecrets which <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recips.php?id=D000000461&amp;type=P&amp;state=&amp;sort=A&amp;cycle=2014">details how much money Comcast has donated to US politicians in the first half of 2014</a>. The number is $2 million across all parties. In a comment on his post AllanAV wrote, “As anyone can see both parties are in bed with Comcast. So no matter if you are republican or democrat lets stand together and defend OUR internet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>metalfreak</strong> submitted an InternetNews.com story that<a href="http://www.internetnews.me/2014/07/19/domain-registry-america-suspended-icann/"> ICANN has suspended Domain Registry of America aka Brandon Gray Internet Services aka NameJuice</a>. The registrar is forbidden from registering any new domain names or accepting any inbound transfers until 17 October 2014. ICANN accuses Brandon Gray’s resellers subjecting Registered Name Holders to false advertising, deceptive practices, or deceptive notices. ICANN would also like an explanation of how the company mined WHOIS records to send unsolicited marketing messages to domain name holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> pointed out the Register article about a study in the journal Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, that found <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/21/banning_handheld_phone_use_by_drivers_had_no_effect_on_accident_rate_study/">California’s 2008 law banning handheld use of cell phones while driving, had no affect on the rate of accidents</a>. The study accounted for seasonal driving differences, weather, gas prices and other factors. The authors believe that even a small amount changing their behavior as a result of the law should have caused a change. Possible explanation could be that hands free cell phone use is just as dangerous, drivers switched to equally dangerous behaviors or that cell phone use is not dangerous to drivers.</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Kind of &#8216;free,&#8217; but not really</strong>: Engadget reports <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/google-wont-call-games-with-in-app-purchases-free-anymore/">The European Commission says Google is responding to its request to change how in-app purchases are handled, but Apple is not</a>. At the end of September, Google will no longer use the word &#8220;free&#8221; to describe games that have in-app purchases and will guide apps not to encourage children to buy things in-app. Apple already implements alerts warning of in-app purchases and other parental controls as well as a kids section of the app store but has not responded to the EC with new strategies. <strong>habichuelacondulce</strong> and<strong> spsheridan</strong> submitted this topic on the subreddit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>But do they carry &#8220;50 Shades of Grey&#8221;?</strong> The test pages must have worked, since Engadget reports <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/amazon-kindle-unlimited/">Amazon has officially launched Kindle Unlimited, an all-you-can read ebook subscription service for $9.99 a month</a>. The service claims to have more than 600,000 books and thousands of audio books. Not all books from major publishers are part of the service, but big names like &#8220;Harry Potter,&#8221; &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; and &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; are among those that are. Independent publishers must agree not to sell their ebooks anywhere but Amazon in order to be part of the service. <strong>spsheridan</strong> and <strong>MANAGEMIKE</strong> submitted this topic on the subreddit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>It&#8217;s 10 inches, I swear:</strong> GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/18/lenovo-says-theres-no-u-s-demand-for-small-windows-tablets-stops-selling-them/">Lenovo announced it will no longer sell Windows-based tablets in North America if they’re smaller than 10 inches.</a> Remaining stock will be diverted to countries where demand is higher including Brazil, China, and Japan. Lenovo will continue to sell smaller Android-based tablets int he North American market.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bitcoins accepted here:</strong> The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/18/dell-starts-accepting-bitcoin-online-purchases-consumers-small-businesses-us/">Dell will start accepting bitcoin for all items sold on Dell.com to U.S. customers</a>. If the pilot program goes well, the company may consider expanding it internationally. Bitcoin payment processor Coinbase will power the payment process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Dude, where&#8217;s my password?</strong> TechCrunch reports on a new search engine called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/18/new-search-engine-unmasks-the-hackers/?ncid=rss">Indexeus, which searches databases of stolen names and passwords. </a>Interestingly, the databases not only include stolen data from big targets like Yahoo and Adobe, but also smaller sites, including some forums where attackers discuss stealing user names and passwords. Brian Krebs tracked down the creator of the index, Jason Relinquo from Lisbon, Portugal. The site charges Bitcoins for various features, though it now allows requests for removal of information for free.</span></p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> posted the TechCrunch story that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/17/the-fcc-has-received-more-than-1000000-comments-on-net-neutrality/?utm_campaign=fb&amp;ncid=fb">the FCC has received more than 1 million comments from the public regarding its proposed Open Internet Guidelines</a>. The comments range from form letters from people like Joe McTrusty to long pleas from groups like Public Knowledge and businesses like AT&amp;T. After tonight the process moves into the stage that allows the public to respond to comments from the first period. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>normgregory</strong> submitted the CNET story that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-prepping-prime-instant-video-for-android-devices-report-says/#ftag=CADf328eec">PC Advisor thinks Amazon is about to release an Amazon Prime Instant Video app for Android</a> and if that isn’t rumory enough for you it could feature 4K resolution. Because reasons! Amazon has an iPad and Kindle Fire app for Amazon Instant Video but only some rather inconvenient workarounds can get it streaming in a browser on Android. Amazon’s Fire phone is due out July 25 which makes CNET’s Scott Webster think that might be the day for a new Android app too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Johnsie776</strong> and <strong>Galcyon</strong> both submitted the story from yesterday that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/17/5913291/level-3-verizon-congestion-netflix">Level 3 believes Verizon implicated themselves in their chart accusing Netflix of being at fault for their own streaming problems. </a>In a continuation of negotiation of business contracts by public press release, Level 3 points out that Verizon admits its interconnection is at capacity and Level 3 magnanimously offers to pay for the equipment to upgrade it, although they less magnanimously did not offer to change their peering arrangement based on the decidedly different ratio of traffic that would be involved. Listen people, I’m not a network engineer. But from what I understand Verizon, Level 3 and Netflix all three are undergoing a rather normal peering negotiation involving a change in forecasted traffic. The only difference in this case vs thousands of previous negotiation carried out by sites like Google, Facebook and more is that its being carried out in public and therefore not being carried out as politely. But it’s all about these companies trying to get the best deal. None of them will share any of the money with you if they win.</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Conscious uncoupling:</strong> Microsoft announced <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/microsoft-job-cuts-far-worse-than-rumored-could-reach-18000/">it will reduce staff by up to 18,000 jobs over the next year, approximately 14% of its staff. </a>12,500 of the reductions will come in the newly acquired Nokia Handset division. Microsoft also told employees it will shift all non-Windows Phone operating system phones into maintenance phones, including Asha, S40 and Android-based Nokia X phones. Future phones will all run Windows Phone OS. Microsoft will also shut down Xbox Entertainment Studios which was making original content for the Xbox. It appears this will not affect the Halo series.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>But I&#8217;m FAMOUS:</strong> Re/Code reports <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/17/you-cant-use-facebooks-new-iphone-app-unless-youre-famous/">Facebook has a new app called ‘Mentions,’ exclusively for the use of verified public figures to make it easier to post publicly on Facebook</a> and see what folks are saying about them. Facebook estimates tens of thousands of users will qualify to use mentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Don&#8217;t you/forget about me/ &#8230; uh, wait:</strong> Marketwatch reports <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/eu-wants-talks-with-google-microsoft-over-right-to-be-forgotten-2014-07-17?link=MW_latest_news">a coalition of European privacy agencies have invited Google, Microsoft and Yahoo to a meeting next Thursday in Brussels to discuss implementation of the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; rules.</a> Microsoft began implementing removal requests in its Bing search engine today. Google has taken some criticism over how it has implemented the policy, which allows individuals to request search results that are no longer relevant to be removed from search indexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Let&#8217;s go shopping!</strong> The Next Web <a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/07/17/facebook-starts-testing-buy-button-news-feed-ads-page-posts-currently-limited-select-us-businesses/">Facebook also announced today it is testing a &#8220;Buy&#8221; button in your Facebook news feed, in cooperation with a few small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. </a>The button allows users to make purchases without leaving Facebook. Payment information will not be shared and users can choose whether to save the info for future purchases or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Oh, by the way &#8230; :</strong> Bloomberg BusinessWeek’s <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-17/how-russian-hackers-stole-the-nasdaq">Michael Riley has an in-depth report of how attackers, suspected of being from Russia</a>, used two zero-day vulnerabilities to gain entry to the NASDAQ Stock Market in 2010, harvest an unknown amount of data and plant destructive malware. NASDAQ announced the infiltration in a brief statement on Feb. 5 2010, but downplayed the extent and significance of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rabbit ears are back:</strong> GigaOm has a story on a startup called <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/17/no-signal-gotenna-has-a-messaging-gadget-that-will-work-in-the-middle-of-nowhere/">GoTenna that’s creating a 6-inch long, baton-like device that can connect iOS and Android phones to each other even in places without cellular or WiFi coverage</a>. The GoTenna connects with phones by BlueTooth and with other batons using peer to peer over 151-154 MHz. Its low bandwidth, but long range, makes it excellent for GPS and text messages. GoTenna is taking preorders today for $150 for a pair of devices and expects to ship this autumn.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pow!

<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>AllanAV</strong> submitted the EFF post regarding an amendment in the US Congress introduced by Representative Marsha Blackburn <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/act-immediately-stop-congresss-sneaky-move-shut-down-broadband-competition">that would stop the FCC from nullifying state laws that prevent cities and towns from creating their own Internet service.</a> Blackburn received $10,000 from the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association this year and last year, according to OpenSecrets.org. She received $12,500 in contributions from Verizon, $10,000 from AT&amp;T, $7,500 from Comcast, and $7,000 from representatives of Time Warner Cable. A roll call vote on Representative Blackburn’s amendment was postponed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Melchizedek74</strong> posted the Android Central story about <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2461013,00.asp">DirectTV offering NFL Sunday Ticket to US residents even without a separate television subscription, seemingly a dream for cord-cutting football fans</a>. PC Mag points out it will only be available to those who live in an apartment where DirecTV is not accessible, attend one of a handful of universities, or reside in New York City, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. It also starts at $200 for the season.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And <strong>the_big_endian</strong> pointed out the CNBC article that <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101838646">the US Copyright Office told Aereo it does not consider it a cable company and would not support its claim to deserve a compulsory license for rebroadcasting TV</a>. &#8220;In the view of the Copyright Office, internet retransmissions of broadcast television fall outside the scope of the Section 111 license.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day:<a href="http://darkskyapp.com/"> Dark Sky </a>via David Wilke</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I&#8217;d recommend the iOS app <a href="http://darkskyapp.com/">Dark Sky</a>. There are a million weather apps out there and most of them try to out do the other based on design. Dark sky out does the others because it&#8217;s accurate. Here&#8217;s the deal&#8230;.it is nearly 100% accurate to the minute as to whether(no pun intended) it&#8217;s going to rain or not based on your geo-location&#8230;.and&#8230;it tells you how hard it&#8217;s going to rain (drizzle, light, heavy, etc). How is that valuable you ask? Well, whenever I&#8217;m at the beach or pool, I know exactly if I should just ride it out or pack it up and head in&#8230;..or&#8230;if I&#8217;m on the golf course&#8230;same thing&#8230;will it be done in 10 min? Is it a drizzle for the next hour so I can continue my golf game? Dark Sky is the best value I&#8217;ve received for an app bar none (I think it&#8217;s $3.99 or 1 gallon of gas).</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Read more here! Just kidding.</strong> GigaOm reports<a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/16/amazon-is-testing-kindle-unlimited-an-ebook-subscription-service-for-9-99month/"> Amazon had some test pages up describing an all-you-can-read book subscription service called Kindle Unlimited</a>. The pages listed the service as $10 a month with access to 600,000 ebooks and thousands of audiobooks. The pages have since been taken down. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1655"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>BlackBerry takes another hit:</strong> The enterprise partnership between Apple and IBM is certainly a concern for Microsoft and Google as they try to encourage corporate adoption for their handsets. However, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/blackberry-ibm-apple/">it could prove deadly for BlackBerry</a>. The troubled Canadian company has bet a lot of its success and the strength of its enterprise management systems like BES and has been making strides toward the ability to manage multiple platforms like Android and iOS. BlackBerry CEO John Chen said, “only underscores the ongoing need for secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions like those BlackBerry has delivered for years.” BlackBerry stock shares took a dip in Wednesday trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>$450M bite of Apple:</strong> Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/16/apple-ebooks-settlement-idUSL2N0PR1JG20140716">Apple agreed to pay $450 million to settle claims the company conspired with five major book publishers to fix ebook prices. </a>The settlement is conditional on the outcome of a pending appeal. A ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York in Apple’s favor would either reduce the amount Apple pays to $70 million or eliminate payments altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Buy It Now:</strong> or PC Mag reports <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2460954,00.asp">Sprint and T-Mobile USA plan to jointly bid around $10 billion in next year’s FCC incentive auction of spectrum relinquished by TV broadcasters</a>. Sprint parent company Softbank wants to acquire T-Mobile USA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Go BlackBerry!</strong> How about some BlackBerry good news? <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/16/siri-google-now-and-cortana-say-hi-to-the-voice-activated-blackberry-assistant/">GigaOM reports a BlackBerry Assistant app is part of the forthcoming BlackBerry 10.3 software update</a>. BlackBerry Assistant seems to be an app-launcher and information provider similar to Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana, but without contextual suggestions like Google Now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Dance, Jibo, DANCE:</strong> Mashable reports on <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/16/jibo-worlds-first-family-robot/">Dr. Cynthia Breazeal’s Indiegogo campaign to fund a family robot called Jibo</a>. The robot can take photos, tell stories while showing images on its touchscreen, and of course, it can dance around and act out things. It even has touch sensors on its head. However, it is not mobile. That keeps the price down to $499. But it does recognize faces, runs on Linux and is programmed in Javascript.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>No freedom fries for you, Ms. Doudet:</strong> The BBC reports <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28331598">Caroline Doudet has been ordered by a French judge to change the title of her blog’s restaurant review and pay €1500 damages</a>. The post was titled &#8220;The place to avoid in Cap-Ferret: Il Giardino&#8221; and described poor service and attitude in Doudet’s opinion. The judge ruled that the post was harmful because it showed up fourth in Google search results. The entire post has been deleted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>We&#8217;re sooo busy, America:</strong> Engadget reports <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/16/senate-passes-unlocking-bill/">the U.S. Senate passed a bill legalizing cell phone unlocking in the U.0.S A similar bill passed the U.S. House with the only difference being a restriction on bulk unlocking</a>. Once the differences are reconciled, the bill can go to the U.S. president and back-alley unlockers will be able to come out into the light of day. Also, the U.S. Congress will get to pretend it actually did something this session.</span></p>
<p><strong>News From You: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ssnapier</strong> posted VentureBeat’s article quoting <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/15/cbs-to-aereo-talk-to-us-but-bring-your-checkbook/">CBS head Les Moonves saying he was “willing to talk” to Aereo about a deal to carry content.</a> Aereo has argued in its current court case it should be allowed to carry broadcast channels under a compulsory license. However broadcasters can choose to require retransmission consent and charge more if they wish. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MikePKennedy</strong> pointed out the verge post on<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5904407/time-warner-21st-century-fox-takeover-bid-rejection"> a New York Times report that Time Warner turned down an $80 billion takeover from 21st Century Fox.</a> The Times sources say Rupert Murdoch is determined to press for a takeover anyway. Fox would sell CNN as part of the deal to avoid conflicts with owning two major cable news channels. Time Warner is made up principally of Turner Broadcasting channels, HBO and Warner Brothers film studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And <strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> posted the Verge article that<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5903405/tesla-announces-new-smaller-electric-vehicle-named-model-3"> Tesla Motors announced its smaller more affordable electric car will be called the Model 3. </a>The vehicle will be 20 percent smaller than the Model S, and go more than 200 miles on a charge. Tesla plans to show off the car in 2016 and put it on sale in 2017.</span></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the Day: </strong><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.fooducate.com/"> Fooducate</a> via Charles Durst</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For food shopping, I can&#8217;t buy anything without scanning it with Fooducate first.</span></p>
<p>It is a curated database of food products submitted by users and evaluated by experts.</p>
<p>All you have to do is scan a product&#8217;s barcode and the app will give the product a letter grade based on the ingredients and nutrition information. It will also tell you how healthy the product is relative to similar products, and it will flag any ingredients that are especially good or bad based on the current research with a link that explains why.</p>
<p>Sometimes the results are surprising. You wouldn&#8217;t believe how different the grades are on two different brands of hummus or other &#8220;healthy&#8221; products.</p>
<p>The app is free for Android [AND APPLE ] with options to report allergens, gluten or track diets with a pro subscription.</p>
<p>I just use the free version, and I find it a lot easier than reading all the ingredients and trying to remember which are supposed to be bad ones.</p>
<p>Too bad it won&#8217;t tell you whether the price is a good deal. <img src="http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest:  <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnieGaus">Annie Gaus</a>, technology journalist</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bug hunters unite:</strong> GigaOm reports <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/07/15/google-will-pay-bug-hunters-to-find-flaws-in-anyones-software-not-just-its-own/?utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_source=yfinance&amp;utm_content=google-will-pay-bug-hunters-to-find-flaws-in-anyones-software-not-just-its-own_857687">Google’s Chris Evans announced Project Zero today, a team of security pros hired by Google to look for vulnerabilities in non-Google software</a>. Any software depended on by a lot of people is fair game. Ben Hawkes, Tavis Ormandy and Brit Ian are apparently on the team, and GeoHotz is the first intern, but they’re also hiring.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-1635"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Layoffs to hit Microsoft:</strong> Bloomberg reports <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/microsoft-said-to-announce-job-cuts-as-soon-as-this-week.html">Microsoft is planning its biggest round of layoffs in five years as part of the integration of Nokia’s handset division. </a>Bloomberg’s sources say the reductions will probably be in engineering, marketing and areas of overlap with Nokia. Microsoft’s biggest round of job cuts ever happened in 2009 when they let 5,800 people go.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>&#8220;Cortana, where&#8217;s my car?&#8221;</strong> The Verge reports <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5901393/windows-phone-8-1-update-lumia-cyan-rolling-out">Microsoft is beginning to distribute Windows Phone 8.1 to existing Lumia devices</a>. 8.1 includes the Cortana digital assistant, new customizable Live Tile layouts, a new keyboard and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Let&#8217;s get connected:</strong> The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/15/thread-yet-another-internet-things-industry-standard/">Samsung, Google and ARM have teamed up to develop an Internet-of-Things wireless networking protocol called Thread. </a>Sound familiar? That’s because the other day Samsung and Intel were among several companies proposing the Open Interconnect Consortium as a new standard for Internet of Things. Thread isn’t an application protocol or a connectivity platform; it’s a networking protocol that has been built upon open standards. A current version of Thread is already in use by Nest thermostats.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Apples cuts out the middleman:</strong> The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2014/07/15/apples-new-itunes-pass-service-lets-users-refill-their-account-in-store-initially-in-japan-only/">Apple has announced a new service in Japan that lets customers add cash to their iTunes account in store</a>. ‘iTunes Pass’ lets users purchase credit in-store for the iTunes Store, App Store, and iBookstore, and have that money immediately applied to the Apple ID account instead of needing to receive a gift card and enter a redemption code.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Smart eyeballs:</strong> Well, now we know why <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/15/google-smart-contact-lens-novartis-sight-diabetes/?ncid=rss_truncated">Babak Parviz left Google for Amazon</a>. His work on Google smart contacts must have been done. Engadget reports Google has licensed its smart eyewear to healthcare specialist Novartis, which will develop new products. The first will be lenses that measure glucose levels in tear fluid to help diabetics. The second will restore focus on near objects so farsighted people can have contacts. Google will develop the electronics and Novartis&#8217; Alcon will supply the medical knowledge. </span></p>

The app has more than 480 million downloads.</span></p>

Rather than trying to have a better algorithm than other efforts like Google Brain, Adam optimizes data handling and fine-tuning communication between machines. The system is based on technology developed at the University of Wisconsin, called Hogwild that for asynchronous processing across the chips within a single machine. Microsoft’s Trishul Chilimbi and team have made it work across an entire network of machines. So far, it has only been deployed through an internal app that recognizes objects based on a photo. It can even identify specific dog breeds. Microsoft is still developing the research and has no consumer plans for the system yet. Microsoft claims it uses 30x fewer machines with double the accuracy of other deep-learning systems.</span></p>

On Monday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a district court didn&#8217;t abuse discretion by denying Fox&#8217;s motion for a preliminary injunction. The underlying case, Fox et al v. Dish et al, will continue to move towards a trial set to begin in federal court in Los Angeles on January 13, 2015.</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Pick of the Day: <a href="http://www.fbpurity.com/">FB Purity</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Dan White in mostly rainy Bristol, UK has our pick of the day: Hi Tom, I&#8217;ve been following the comments about Facebook and the annoying way that they mess with your news feed, changing the order and stuffing unwanted junk in to annoy you. I&#8217;d like to recommend a free browser plug in called &#8220;<a href="http://www.fbpurity.com/">FB purity</a>&#8220;. I like to think of it as what Facebook would look like if they didn&#8217;t hate their users! It&#8217;s compatible with Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera and Maxton.</span></p>
<p>It has an awesome collection of features, including:<br />
Force news feed onto chronological order. Block in line video playback. Hide or block posts based on keywords or phrases (handy for those Game of Thrones spoiler posting idiot friends) Revert news feed to single column. Stop external links from being tracked by Facebook. Block applications directly from your news feed. Receive an alert if someone de-friends you. And lots more.</p>
<p>Naturally Facebook hates this idea and regularly tweaks their code to overcome some features, even claiming that it is &#8220;unsafe&#8221; (well they would, wouldn&#8217;t they!). However, the plug in is inevitably updated almost immediately to restore sanity to your experience.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t work for or have any connection to the FB Purity coders. I just think it&#8217;s an awesome plug in, and apparently about 160,000 other people agree with me.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>EXTRA Message:</strong> TVsEgon has posted tons of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bhp2ejkql0pcjt6/AAAnPWnqJWhXi9-IsVERWb-Ka">Nerdtacular pic</a>s to a dropbox. You can find the link in the subreddit or the show notes!</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Pick of the Day:<a href="http://joeisanerd.com/apps/icatcher"> iCatcher</a> via Preston in Silly-con Valley</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Preston in lovable Silly-Con Valley has our pick of the day:</span></p>
<p>Most of the time I hear a recommendation for a podcasting app it is usually for Downcast or Pocketcast. Though I&#8217;m sure these are very good I just wanted to throw a new one into the mix. For almost 3 years now I&#8217;ve been using<a href="http://joeisanerd.com/apps/icatcher"> iCatcher</a> for my podcasting enjoyment. Talking to a friend who uses Downcast we were comparing features. iCatcher seems to match Downcast pretty much feature for feature. It has both global and podcast-specific settings. Can be set to download over wifi only or cellular as well. Custom skip forward and back lengths. Start a podcast X seconds in. (Handy for skipping shows with long intros.) Supports video podcasts (including alternate playback speeds). Etc, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>One thing we did find was playback speeds differed a bit. iCatcher offers 3/4, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2 and 3 times playback speeds. I listen at 1.25 and my friend listens at 1.5 using downcast. But here&#8217;s the thing, they are actually the same speeds. He said he noticed one day that a 1 hour podcast played at 1.5x speed took almost 50 minutes to get through and so wasn&#8217;t done after his 40 minute commute. He contacted the developers and said they confirmed that that playback speeds are a bit off and they do it on purpose but didn&#8217;t explain why. I confirmed iCatcher is accurate by listening to a 56 minute podcast at 1.25x and timing it. It finished in about 45 minutes which is correct. 56 / 1.25 = 44.8 minutes.</p>
<p>iCatcher is also very well supported and always adding new features through regular updates. iCatcher is $2.99 and worth every penny in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ancrod2</strong> posted the TechCrunch story that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/cell-phone-unlocking-bill-clears-senate-committee/">a version of The Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act was amended and approved by a US Senate Committee and sent to the Senate floor for a full vote</a>.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>metalfreak</strong> called attention to the Ars Technica article from yesterday that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/emergency-windows-update-revokes-dozens-of-bogus-google-yahoo-ssl-certificates/">Microsoft issued an emergency update for most versions of Windows to prevent attacks using digital certificates that impersonate sites like Google and Yahoo</a>. The update update blocks 45 SSL certificates that attackers managed to generate after compromising systems operated by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) of India. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MikePKennedy</strong> submitted the Engadget story about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/11/amazon-book-shipping-france/">Amazon’s response to a French law banning free shipping of books and taking away the companies right to give a 5% discount on book titles. </a>Amazon will now charge one eurocent for shipping in France.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> posted the WPXI story about <a href="http://www.wpxi.com/ap/ap/strange/pa-men-get-draft-notices-100-years-after-the-fact/ngckk/">the US Selective Service System, sending draft notices to 14,000 Pennsylvania men born between 1893 and 1897.</a> The men are likely all dead, but they were warned they must register for the draft anyway. The error happened because birthdates were stored with only the last two digits of the year and a clerk working with the database forgot to specify the century when generating notices.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Both <strong>lythander</strong> and<strong> TVSEgon</strong> posted stories about <a href="http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/why-is-netflix-buffering-dispelling-the-congestion-myth">Verizon’s response to Netflix’s accusations that Verizon’s network is congested</a>. In a long post filled with charts and arrows, Verizon, rightly, points out that Netflix could use other transit providers to get around congestion but refuses to do so. Netflix has said that if Verizon would upgrade the interconnection with its preferred transit provider this wouldn’t be a problem. Both companies are using you as a bargaining chip while trying to reduce their own costs.</span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Microsoft CEO <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-10/satya-nadellas-memo-makes-productivity-the-new-mantra-at-microsoft">Satya Nadella published an email memo to his employees on the company website today, laying out his vision for all to see. </a>The 3100 word manifesto claims Microsoft is no longer so much about devices and services as it is about productivity and platform. Nadella used the word productivity 20 times in the memo. One notable exception to the productivity push was the Xbox. Nadella said Microsoft would “continue to innovate and grow our fan base with Xbox.” He also showed his literary bent quoting Nietzsche and Rilke.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">9to5 Google reports <a href="http://9to5google.com/2014/07/10/ftc-now-alleging-amazon-is-also-unlawfully-billing-parents-for-childrens-in-app-purchases/">the US FTC announced it is filing a complaint against Amazon, alleging that children can buy things in apps without parental consent</a>. Amazon changed its in-app purchase policy last month but the commission wants full refunds for affected parents and a court order forcing Amazon to continue to get permission before in-app purchases. Apple settled with the FTC over similar issues earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TechCrunch reports <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/amazon-goes-after-box-dropbox-and-huddle-launches-zocalo-for-secure-enterprise-storage/">Amazon is launching a secure enterprise storage service called Zocalo in limited preview today.</a> Amazon says the service lets users “store, share, and gather feedback on documents, spreadsheets, presentations, webpages, images, PDFs, or text files – from the device of their choice.” Pricing is $5 per user per month, which includes 200 GB of storage for each user. Amazon Workspaces customers get Zocalo for free but at 50 GB a user. 200GB per user costs an extra $2 a month for those customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">LinkedIn may be retiring its Contacts app, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/linkedin-steps-up-its-ai-play-turns-its-contacts-app-into-a-new-connected-app/">TechCrunch reports they’ve launched a new replacement called LinkedIn Connected. </a>More than just a contacts manager, the new app will try to alert you to information about your contacts that you need to know, such as profile updates, job changes, birthdays and more. The new app will only be available in English speaking countries and on iOS for now, though Android is on the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TechCrunch reports on a new app for Google Glass called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/forget-ok-glass-mindrdr-is-a-new-google-glass-app-that-you-control-with-your-thoughts/">MindRDR. It works in conjunction with the Neurosky EGG biosensor, to read brainwaves. </a>The app translates the brainwaves into a meter you see in glass. Focus hard enough to lift the meter and a picture is taken. Focus harder and the picture is Tweeted. It’s a small start— TO MIND CONTROL! Neurosky retails for £71 in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/10/us-google-china-idUSKBN0FF18520140710?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">Google services are working again in China more than a month after maps, email and other functions were blocked. </a>The disruption began int he run-up to the 25th anniversary of demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Line, KakaoTalk, Flickr and OneDrive also began experiencing disruption in China last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">MANY of you, including <strong>normgregory</strong> and <strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> on the subreddit pointed out the Aereo letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan which argues <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aereo-trying-to-escape-from-legal-limbo-155442245.html">since the US Supreme Court ruled Aereo has an “overhwelming likeness to the cable comanies” Aereo should get to benefit from their legal protections.</a> Specifically Aereo would like to be allowed to pay the compulsory license fee set up for cable companies in Section 111 of the Copyright Act of 1976. Broadcasters told the court they found this request “astonishing,” but they really have nothing to worry about. The 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act provides the broadcasters the right to demand Retransmission consent which they can charge for. Most likely they could just charge Aereo more than it could afford and be done with them. However the broadcasters don’t want a precedent set that a cable company operating over the Internet is the same as one operating over traditional cables. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Next Web reports <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/10/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-donates-1m-help-oatmeal-artist-build-nikola-tesla-museum/">The Oatmeal’s Matthew Inman confirmed that Elon Musk has pledged to donate $1 million toward Inman’s effort to turn Nikola Tesla’s former laboratory into a museum.</a> Tesla will also construct a supercharging station for Tesla cars in the museum’s parking lot. Today is also Nikola Tesla’s birthday. He is 158.</span></p>
<p><strong>News from You:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> submitted the GeekWire report on <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/microsoft-bings-flawless-world-cup-prediction-engine-picks-germany-win/">Microsoft Bing’s preternatural ability to predict the World Cup Soccer results. </a>Bing has predicted every one of the 14 knockout round matches correctly. It only got 60% of the group matches right. Bing uses data like team records, strength of schedule, margin of victory in past matches, home field advantage, weather and playing surface among others. It predicts Germany will beat Argentina in the final.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>fja</strong> sent in the BBC story that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237108">emergency legislation will be brought in next week in the UK to force phone and Internet companies to log records of customer calls, texts and internet use.</a> A recent ruling of the European Court of Justice has removed the obligation on telecoms companies to retain records of when and who their customers have called, texted and emailed. The three major parties in the UK all agree that the data needs to be retained to aid law enforcement. The emergency legislation will not extend previous rights and will create a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board as well require transparency reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>jcsheffield</strong> posted the Wired story about <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/material-science-flexible-display/">research published in the journal Nature today describing the first steps toward creating a new type of ultrathin, superfast, low-power, high-resolution, flexible color screen. </a>The displays use phase-change materials that change between crystal and disordered glass in response to a current. The material, known as GST can be layered on mylar to create a flexible screen. As usual it will be years and hundreds of millions of dollars before you can buy contact lenses made of the stuff, but hey, someday!</span></p>

<p><strong>Pick of the day:</strong> <a href="https://www.waze.com/">Waze!</a> via Jennie</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now I&#8217;ve recommended <a href="https://www.waze.com/">Waze </a>to you before, but yesterday Jennie was driving down from Connecticut to New York City at 10:30pm at night and ran into terrible stand still traffic. Her Apple map program had nothing to say about this, so she opened up Waze, a community-based traffic and navigation app. Jennie discovered that due to construction, I-95 was down to ONE LANE. She says there was something very comforting about knowing that ten Waze-rs were ahead of her in the jam, showing her exactly where the crunch began and ended. Armed with their knowledge, Jennie was able to exit I-95 and drive the streets of Stamford, CT for a mile and a half, then get back on the highway post-construction and cruise on home to New York City. So thanks Waze! </span></p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest: Michael Wolf of The Next Market podcast</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">SamMobile reports <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2014/07/08/exclusive-samsungs-virtual-reality-headset-will-be-called-gear-vr-launch-at-ifa-2014/">Samsung’s virtual reality device, allegedly called “Gear VR” will be announced alongside the new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 at the IFA conference in Berlin</a>. Sort of a higher tech version of Google’s Cardboard, Gear VR will connect to a Galaxy device by USB 3.0 and make use of the phone’s sensors to track head motion. IFA kicks off September 5th. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1599"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Bloomberg has an article about how<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-08/silicon-valley-s-talent-grab-spawns-high-school-interns.html"> landing top talent is getting tough in Silicon Valley</a>. So much so that firms like Facebook are flying High Schoolers out to meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg in order to win them over from a young age. A chart from GlassDoor shows interns earning more than $5,000 a month at places like Apple Google, NVidia and Amazon, and those companies don’t even pay the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">CNET reports <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-loses-patent-case-in-china-over-siri-functionality/">Apple lost a patent case in China to Shanghai’s Zhizhen Internet Technology over a speech-recognition patent.</a> Zhizhen claims their patent is violated by the way Siri recognizes and analyzes a person’s speech. Apple plans to appeal the decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Recode reports LG introduced <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/08/lg-intros-a-cellular-equipped-wristband-to-help-parents-keep-track-of-their-kids/">KizOn Tuesday, a wearable device designed to allow parents to track their preschool and elementary children</a>. The wristband has a button to call a predefined number and can receive calls from parents. It’s set to debut July 10 in South Korea before eventually making its way to North America and Europe in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">ZDNet passes on that <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/quarterly-tablet-pc-shipments-to-fall-for-the-first-time-ever-7000031400/">NPD DisplaySearch’s report shows tablet PCs declined year over year for the first time ever, to 56 million units. </a>NPD DisplaySearch has lowered its forecast for tablet PC shipments in 2014 to 285 million units. The fall comes mostly in the 7-7.9-inch tablets feeling pressure from larger phones in the 5-6 inch range. Replacement cycles for tablets are also lengthening.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Next Web reports that <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/07/09/flurry-xiaomi-is-stealing-some-of-the-apple-magic-in-china-as-its-users-spend-more-time-in-apps/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=profeed&amp;utm_reader=feedly">time spent with apps on Xiaomi phones has surpassed iPhones in China according to mobile firm Flurry</a>. A random sample of 23,000 devices in China throughout January 2014 found the average Xiaomi user spent 7 percent more time in apps compared to Apple. The average Samsung user spent 14 percent less time than an iPhone user, while a HTC consumer spent 27 percent less time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Next Web also has some good news for Facebook in the Philippines. A report from OnDevice research shows <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/07/09/facebook-messenger-outguns-whatsapp-asias-chat-apps-philippines/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=profeed&amp;utm_reader=feedly">80 percent of mobile users in the Phillipines are regular Facebook Messenger users</a>. Second place at 27% is Skype and Viber. Normally popular apps in Asia like We Chat and Line are near the bottom of the list at 15% and 10% respectively. Also interesting to note 70 percent of the country’s 40 million Internet users are younger than 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Google posted on<a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2014/07/mirror-your-android-screen-to-tv-with.html"> the Android blog that screen mirroring from Android devices to Chromecast is now enabled</a>. To start mirroring, simply select “Cast Screen” from the navigation drawer in the Chromecast app and select your Chromecast device. On Nexus devices, this feature is also available through the quick settings menu. The feature is in beta and will roll out to various devices over the next few days. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">THIS JUST IN Matt Chapman told Jeff Rubin of the Jeff Rubin Show that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/9/5884841/homestar-runner-creator-says-hes-bringing-his-internet-cartoon-back">the Chapman Brothers plan to start making more HomestarRunner cartoons</a>. That April Fool’s Day thing was a test and we passed Internet, We passed. More StrongBad emails are coming. Soon. Maybe Strongbad’s Lappy will even be rocking a Pentium!</span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>therobertonline</strong> posted the 9to5 Google story about <a href="http://9to5google.com/2014/07/08/androids-stock-data-wipe-tools-doesnt-fully-delete-your-personal-files-can-allow-easy-recovery/">security researchers from Avast showing that Android’s factory reinstall only cleans at the application layer, leaving loads of personal data behind</a>. Using off the self drive imaging programs like FTK Imager on 20 smartphones purchased from eBay, Avast recovered more than 40,000 photos, 750 emails and text messages, and even a completed loan application. Coincidentally, Avast has a tool they say does a better job, but encrypting your data, and wiping a phone loading fake data and wiping again are also good suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MikePKennedy</strong> sent in the Next Web article pointing out <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/07/09/googles-chrome-remote-desktop-extension-now-supports-linux-systems/">Google has announced its remote access plugin fro Chrome now works for Linux users</a>. That means remote access from Chrome now works acrtoss Windows OS X Android and Linux, although for that last you need to be running the Ubuntu or Debian distros for it to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>KAPT_Kipper</strong> posted the Engadget story that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/09/flash-rosetta-exploit-discovered/">Google engineer Michele Spagnuolo discovered a critical security flaw in Adobe Flash</a>. The so-called “Rosetta Flash&#8221; is a proof of concept, but could allow hackers to steal your cookies and other data using malicious Flash .SWF files. Many companies have patched their sites, but not all, so you’ll want to get the fix from Adobe in the latest version of Flash 10.0.0.145 and if you use Adobe AIR update that to 14.0.0.137 too. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally <strong>tm204</strong> submitted a National Journal posting about<a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/senate-panel-passes-cybersecurity-bill-despite-nsa-fears-20140708"> the Senate Intelligence Committee approving legislation Tuesday to make it easier for companies to share information regarding cyberthreats with each other and the US Government</a>. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act or CISA is meant to remove legal barriers to cooperation against cyberattacks, while still protecting user privacy by stripping out personally identifiable information of known Americans. Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall voted against the legislation, saying in a statement that it &#8220;lacks adequate protections for the privacy rights of law-abiding Americans, and that it will not materially improve cybersecurity.&#8221; Sen. Saxby Chambliss, said the bill is a carefully crafted compromise between business groups and privacy advocates.</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Pick of the Day: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks">My Tracks </a>via Vance McAlister</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(As you might expect from me, another Google app, this time one very few seem to know about, I just discovered it myself!)</span></p>
<p>I wanted to point everyone to an almost unknown little app from Google called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks">My Tracks</a>. It most closely resembles apps like Runkeeper which track your walking, running or biking. It has large, friendly buttons for Start, Pause and Stop during your workout and then gives you the standard stats afterwards, including a map. A few fun features are that you can follow your progress on the map while you are moving, it will give you a &#8220;fly-over&#8221; movie of your movement on a 3D Google Map, and it will keep a copy of each workout map saved in a special folder in Google Drive. Super simple to use, and dead easy, but maybe not as full-featured as Runkeeper or Runtastic. Definitely worth trying out since it is free.</p>

<p><b>Show Notes</b></p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/Snubs">Shannon Morse</a> of <a href="http://hak5.org/">hak5.org</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Headlines</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Samsung reported earnings a little down. <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/07/samsung-says-second-quarter-tablet-sales-sluggish-as-smartphone-growth-slowed/">Q2 sales were approximately 52 trillion Korean won ($51.4 billion) and operating profit was about 7.2 trillion won ($7.1 billion).</a> Both numbers are down from last quarter and a year ago. Samsung blamed sluggish demand for tablets, a slowdown in smartphone sales and strong Korean currency for the declines. The company predicted stronger smartphone sales with the coming release of its new smartphone lineup. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-1590"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">PC Mag passes along a video from Marques Brownlee who got ahold of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2460606,00.asp?kc=PCRSS03069TX1K0001121&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ziffdavis%2Fpcmag%2Fbreakingnews+(PCMag.com+Breaking+News)">an alleged iPhone 6 screen made of sapphire crystal. </a>Brownlee attempts to scratch the screen with keys and a knife and tries to bend it and break it to no avail. The part is a 4.7-inch screen and certainly looks like an iPhone. It’s possible that gorilla glass might hold up to some of the same abuse, but Brownlee claims his sources are reliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/07/intel-samsung-and-others-create-new-qualcomm-free-internet-of-things-consortium/">Samsung, Broadcom, Atmel and Wind River (an Intel company itself) are teaming up on yet another Internet of Things standards alliance, much like All Seen Alliance, Industrial Internet Consortium MQTT and XMP</a>. This new one has the name Open Interconnect Consortium and will see all the companies collaborate on code set to come out in Q3. The goal is create a peer-to-peer protocol that handles discoverability and authentication better. Qualcomm has worked on a similar standard called AllJoyn which it open sourced through the AllSeen Alliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Reuters reports <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/08/us-tesla-motors-china-idUSKBN0FD0TW20140708">Chinese businessman Zhan Baosheng is taking Tesla Motors to court over the use of the name Tesla for sales and marketing of Tesla cars in China</a>. Tesla said in January that the trademark dispute was resolved, and began delivering Model S sedans to Chinese customers in April. The Beijing Third Intermediate Court will hear the case on Aug. 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">GigaOm reports <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/08/uber-will-end-surge-pricing-in-emergencies-after-deal-with-new-york-ag/">Uber has agreed with the State of New York not to raise prices during “emergencies and natural disasters.”</a> Uber will adopt a similar policy nationwide. Uber did not specify what counts as a disaster, but you can bet New Year’s Eve is not considered one and surge pricing will still rear its costly head from time to time. </span></p>
<p><b>News From You</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>devham</strong> submitted the DroidLife article about <a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2014/06/25/google-search-3-5-14-adds-ok-google-hotword-everywhere-plus-audio-history/">Google letting users enable the “OK Google” hotword to be said from any screen on the phone, not just the home screen, to prompt a voice search</a>. To turn it on in Google Now, scroll to the bottom and tap Menu&gt;Settings&gt;Voice&gt;”Ok Google” Detection and turn on the options you want. This also adds Audio History which learns the sound of your voice and how you pronounce words.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Draconos</strong> pointed us to the Slashdot post that <a href="http://search-beta.slashdot.org/story/14/07/08/0119254/microsoft-kills-off-mappoint-and-streets-and-trips-in-favor-of-bing-maps">Microsoft has ended updates for MapPoint and Streets &amp; Trips. </a>Both services will be retired in favor of Bing Maps. The fate of the two services has been noted on both their websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>tm204</strong> posted the Engadget story about <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/08/slingshot-new-zealand-isp-global-mode-vpn-netflix/">New Zealand ISP Slingshot offering a Global Mode VPN feature that allows customers to access normally georestricted Internet content</a>.  Marketing for the feature originally mentioned making visitors from other countries feel more at a home but then Slingshot General Manager Taryn Hamilton confirmed to the New Zealand Herald that &#8220;No beating around the bush. This is to watch Netflix.” Refreshingly candid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And<strong> magoojc</strong> submitted the TechCrunch article that points out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/08/blackberry-is-one-of-the-hottest-stocks-of-2014-seriously/?ncid=rss">Blackberry stock is 50% on the year and is one of the best performing stocks in its sector. </a>Yes. BlackBerry. By comparison Apple is up 20% and Google just 5. So far revenue has not improved but the company has cut costs which investors like. Blackberry has also not made any bold moves this year other than the square Passport phone meaning you can’t accuse the company of doing much wrong. </span></p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Pick of the Day via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BF2M21C/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Simple TV</a> Steve Boland</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Amazon is still selling a basic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BF2M21C/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Simple TV</a> with LIFETIME service for $120. Yes, I had to buy a hard drive, but once it was set up, I get live or recorded TV streamed (slung?) to my Roku, my computer, my tablet or whatever anywhere I am. Avoiding monthly or annual fees was important to me in getting this set up, so good to know there is a cheap option for this. Thanks for everything you do! Steve<br />
